The man's aggressive and immature behavior was a clear sign that I shouldn't do business with them. I prefer not to give my money to those who act so rudely and inconsiderately. My advice for them would be to drive more carefully, safely, and be more aware of their behavior, avoiding aggression while doing so. This occurred in the company car on 3/14/24 around 6pm Downtown Houston.","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"112813418368329289788|0x864095fd74e40627:0x6a06edf58c5b95bb","media":null,"created_time":"2024-03-18 06:03:27.882580","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Sergio P√©rez Garc√≠a","external_id":"102009297779546154424","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102009297779546154424","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":21,"photos":22},"text":"Excelent company!","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102009297779546154424|0x864095fd74e40627:0x6a06edf58c5b95bb","media":null,"created_time":"2023-07-18 22:03:27.882580","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Maria Lopez","external_id":"104128362705876203822","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104128362705876203822","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":"Negative\n\nProfessionalism","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104128362705876203822|0x864095fd74e40627:0x6a06edf58c5b95bb","media":null,"created_time":"2023-06-18 12:03:27.882580","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Drew Griffin","external_id":"106351515198098282486","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106351515198098282486","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":"Went to apply there for work I was way over qualified and did not receive a call back","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106351515198098282486|0x864095fd74e40627:0x6a06edf58c5b95bb","media":null,"created_time":"2023-06-18 06:14:41.143866","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Tracy Mitchell","external_id":"106329971833337912081","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106329971833337912081","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":7,"photos":2},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106329971833337912081|0x864095fd74e40627:0x6a06edf58c5b95bb","media":null,"created_time":"2023-04-20 06:16:36.092306","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Brandon Parker","external_id":"106717845744237604490","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106717845744237604490","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":139,"photos":123},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106717845744237604490|0x864095fd74e40627:0x6a06edf58c5b95bb","media":null,"created_time":"2023-03-26 10:49:29.119946","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"joseph lawson","external_id":"106563356120891348204","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106563356120891348204","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":1},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106563356120891348204|0x864095fd74e40627:0x6a06edf58c5b95bb","media":null,"created_time":"2023-02-24 12:05:43.700055","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Doni lii","external_id":"109262849685164479447","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109262849685164479447","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"WOW!!!

I was very nervous through the whole process, but Jim and Gabrielle held my annoying hand every step of the way. I have worked with 3 other companies that kept putting band aids on my poor drainage and soil problems. Jim and Gabriella came up with a plan, it was a bit like having your pipes redone at first, very expensive for things I thought I wouldn't really see but we were sick of replacing sod annually and watering all summer for the grass to die anyways. The team came in and took several layers of clay off the top of my yard, regraded the entire yard and added some amazing fertilizers, compost and other organic stuff before planting a beautiful ground cover that is much more drought tolerant than grass and better roots to keep all my new dirt in place. They cleaned and replanted all my beds and found me the perfect tree and boy am I picky! They added pavers all around my yard and pool creating a really beautiful natural looking area that is functional and stunning. I can't tell you how happy I am and have high hopes that I will have a beautiful yard for years to come instead of having to sink time and money into it every year to patch problems. I very much appreciate their expertise and their team's execution.

I've had so many tree trimmers come by that can \"do it for $100 cheaper\", but either aren't certified arborists, or don't seem to really care about the trees (eg they ask me where to cut, rather than suggest what's healthiest for the tree).\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nSummer of 2021, Craig (owner of ALS) did an on-site consult shortly after contacting him. I had (6) trees removed, and one large Oak trimmed. I had (3) other companies quote the same work - with nearly identical pricing. I picked ALS because: 1) Craig was the only one that was truly an arborist (not just a \"tree trimmer\"), and incredibly knowledgeable (more below), 2) their reviews are outstanding, 3) incredibly easy to work with (clear and great communication, quote, quick response, etc.), and 4) competitive price (~$8-900/tree inc. grinding).\nHe outsources the actual cutting & hauling, and the team was great. They arrived on-time, kept the worksite tidy, and were respectful to neighbors (they had to get on their land for some of the work). They placed mulch (from stump grinding) where I asked for it, and were impressive with their speed (~2 days) - and, above all, did it safely!\nI plan to continue to use ALS for high-limb trimming, and consulting in overall tree health.\nCraig's knowledge about trees is saving me money. Other people are \"tree-trimmers\" - Craig is an arborist. He ID'd my trees instantly, and walked around my 1/2 acre lot IDing all my trees. He told me whether they're healthy, and what to watch out for (\"this tree drops tiny bits of sap, which can get annoying\", \"this tree will drop leaves in the fall before others - but don't worry, that's normal and healthy\"). He prevented me from removing a beautiful Magnolia that hadn't yet bloomed, which I thought was an ugly Holly! I could go on, but if you have any variety of trees, old trees, or a lot of trees - Craig is a valuable asset.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"109854110464697723676|0x8640905db389624f:0x47bfce6006cdb23b","media":null,"created_time":"2023-06-18 12:03:28.459625","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:03:28.459625","text":"Thanks for taking the time out of your day to write such a nice review.

He was derogatory to my wife when he wasn‚Äôt aware that I was listening on the phone calls. He will tell you a story about being homeless and then demand you to pay outside of your agreed upon contract. At multiple points throughout our project, he promised that crews would arrive that day who never showed up and we got no updates from him for days. He sends updates on other peoples homes because he can‚Äôt keep track of who you are. When we reached our breaking point, he promised the project would be completed on a certain day. At the end of that day, he texted us photos of someone else‚Äôs house with the text ‚ÄúI told you it would be done today!‚Äù It seems that he prioritizes jobs based on value. While he was neglecting our home, he was regularly posting in-person instagram updates on a $200k job that was apparently more important.

The first time I used LCE was to tear out some horrid wooden boards that served as a flower/bush bed. After discussing pricing with Nick, he advised that pavers were the best option for the price and then we selected colors. While Nick was at the home to quote, he also priced tearing down and rebuilding a brick wall which my front gate anchored to as it was starting to lean. Nick‚Äôs price was the most competitive of the 3 options I looked at. The second time I used Nick was to install a PVC drainage system to stop a water pooling and flooding issue in my backyard when it rains heavy and the water start to encroach on my home. He and a colleague dug the trench, cut tree roots, laid the pipe and French drains and even tied in a gutter from the roof above which is where the majority of the water was coming from. He then topped off the trench and drains with large rocks for debris filtration. I have had several large/heavy downpours since the system was installed and the water never builds up so my home is protected. I highly recommend Nick due to he and his team‚Äôs professionalism, communication and good pricing.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"113060518910708000381|0x8640950cec262369:0xc528543a6efe6c58","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-27 12:03:28.839365","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-06-06 17:57:42.755947","text":"Thank you so much Mark for taking the time in writing this review.

They left my driveway looking great.\nThe only negatives I really have is the sod they put in was St Augustine but a lot of weeds have come up within the first 2 weeks, so I'd ask where they source their sod from and research the sod farm.\nI also had a very specific timeline as to when each phase was to be done which was not followed.  The idea was that on day 1 they would do the tear out, day 2 I'd be able to make sprinkler and fence repairs, day 3 they would do the install.

Gutters were 10/10 and the path was 6/10 for what I paid.\nThen I hired them to do my sprinklers. Within a week, a pump they installed had burst and flooded my yard. They came out and repaired it in a few days.\nA week later, I noticed that the sprinklers were still not working properly and flooding my yard on a daily basis. I asked them to come out and look at them. I was blown off for weeks - and even one month later, still have not had anyone come and look at my yard.\nThey had no issue following up with me multiple times asking me to pay for the next potential project, but could not care less regarding that they did a poor job with sprinklers. The ONLY way I received any replies was by requesting a quote for additional drainage [which was not needed, but was caused by the flooding sprinklers.]\nWhen I asked them to itemize my quote, they refused to do so. I was quoted $4500 for about 10x2 feet of black star gravel and 1 pallet of sod. By far, the most egregious price I have ever received for a job of that size. I have been quoted $800 in materials & labor for a pallet of sod before, and around $350 for the same amount of black star gravel.\nAfter being ignored for weeks and realizing that they did not care, I hired someone to inspect it on my own who informed me that the pump they repaired was never turned back on. The sprinklers were failing to pop up and flooded my yard daily, causing several massive mud pits which are going to cost a fair amount of money to resod.\nIt's hard finding a decent landscaping company. This company was very professional, but they will stop caring about you once you have paid them.\n‚Äî\nEDIT:\nEditing to clarify the fact that they responded to my review and stated I turned the pump off. They turned the pump off during a repair after it blew. I never touched the pump, which the owner is very well aware of. I texted them TWELVE times over the course of 40+ days to come and check on it. Was repeatedly ghosted regarding this.\nThey pointed out ONE area in my yard by my deck which they wanted me to run additional drainage to ($5,000 quote which I saw as unnecessary as this area has not had any issues with flooding.) They are NOT accurately responding to this review; all of the areas which flooded are wherever the sprinklers were placed and have nothing to do with grading anywhere. The pump that they failed to turn on caused sprinkler heads to not eject and simply flood the areas they were placed in.\nI offered them to come out if they‚Äôd like to make it right and instead was asked to ‚Äúcut them some slack,‚Äù and told ‚Äúit‚Äôs weak,‚Äù for me to ‚Äúkick them while they‚Äôre down after giving a bad review,‚Äù\nReceived a quote for $1,250 to do the job which they quoted me $5,500 on. Please find a better landscaping company and save yourself from working with this unprofessional company. They will get the work done as quickly as possible to get paid and then will cease to care about you and their work.","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"112110433566355455789|0x8640c577e320983f:0x2e28a94e8e0a5d9c","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-22 22:49:42.020650","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-05-20 12:03:29.766983","text":"Nafez,Before installing the sprinklers we pointed out the low spots in your backyard. ‚Ä¶Nafez,Before installing the sprinklers we pointed out the low spots in your backyard.

But with a growing 14-year-old who wants to hang out with friends, we wanted to make our backyard much more livable and a place that could accommodate a number of teenagers.\nFrom the start Chris and his team were very engaged, listening to our ideas and coming in with many of their own. We didn't hire Texan Landscape Group to tell them how to do their job ‚Äì we hired them based on their expertise and ideas.\nOnce the project started it only took ten days, which was amazing. After literally scaping everything in the backyard, they added a patio cover with gable roof (also hanging a fan and adding outlets throughout), new pavers under the existing patio and new patio cover with integrated drainage, turf throughout, and a bed of blackstar gravel along the back fence with 10 trees, 5 with uplighting. They also replanted our front beds with hearty selection of \"Houston-friendly\" plants.\nWe would absolutely recommend Chris and his team to anyone. Communication is the most important part of any job like this, and Chris was very easy to get a hold of at any time, and extremely responsive. And while we experienced very few setbacks, we also realize no job is perfect. In my opinion it's how one handles bumps along the way that really separates you from the rest. Chris and Texan Landscape Group addressed any issues we had right away and exceeded any expectations we may have had.\nWe look forward to spending a lot of time in our backyard and love having a place our teen can gather with his friends.

My parents hired this company to handle various landscaping tasks, including the installation of a paver walkway, mulch, and shrubs. Unfortunately, the execution of these tasks fell far below expectations.\nThe problems began with the inadequate preparation of the area before planting the shrubs, as grass and weeds were not properly removed. Even worse, the mulch was overrun with weeds, indicating a lack of attention to detail. My Dad had to step in to rectify the situation by removing all the mulch and weeds, adding more soil, and planting sod in the area.\nHowever, the most significant issue arose with the walkway installation. Despite being assured of a professional job, the walkway was poorly constructed, resulting in water pooling in the middle for hours after rainfall. This was due to improper grading, causing water to stagnate until it evaporated. When my parents raised their concerns, they were met with dismissive responses from William, who insisted that the walkway was constructed within industry guidelines and tolerances. His refusal to acknowledge the problem or take responsibility was deeply frustrating.\nAdding insult to injury, there is already a crack in the concrete on the side of the walkway and my Dad was told they would only repair it if it worsened. This lack of accountability is unacceptable, especially considering the substantial cost of the project.\nAs the first home in their subdivision, my parents take pride in maintaining their property, and it's disheartening that Earthworks' sloppy workmanship and poor customer service reflect negatively on their home. Despite their reluctance to cause a fuss, I refuse to let them be taken advantage of.\nIn conclusion, based on our experience, we cannot in good faith recommend Earthworks Landscape and Maintenance. Their subpar work and lack of accountability have left us thoroughly dissatisfied, and we urge others to seek alternative options for their landscaping needs.\nUpdate from my Parents\nAfter posting negative reviews on social media and the BBB, Earthworks agreed to correct our poorly constructed paver walkway. Earthworks corrected the grading of a section of the sidewalk. Now, water no longer form puddles after it rains or my sprinklers run.¬† They also properly sealed the sidewalk by using a paint roller to apply the sealant. When the walkway was originally constructed,¬† the workers sprayed the sealant onto the sidewalk carelessly and caused unremovable white spots to form on the sidewalk.¬† ¬†After the sealant was reapplied with the roller, most of the spots disappeared and is now acceptable.\nOverall,¬† I am now satisfied with my walkway.¬† It's still disappointing that Earthworks initially told me there was nothing wrong with the sidewalk and only agreed to fix it after we posted negative reviews.","rating":3.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114428923647480350496|0x864746397d876239:0xcae96e00c9ee6e67","media":["AF1QipMVWuwrqXpJn0To8cFkEzn7FVK8_toNiRlrt9PU","AF1QipPEr3Us8_jYBR_OFYDNgYdk8XL-XQXf3weLptsM","AF1QipPpP6Vst5LhinEcVUo_Q8lfJqezdWcXSZnT_vHU","AF1QipMXu4e0nBCsTKjlnjrxaJT4fuP7D8f-gfe96VWr"],"created_time":"2024-05-18 02:03:29.905138","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-05-13 22:59:07.781878","text":"Dear Qurita, ‚Ä¶Dear Qurita,We sincerely apologize for the disappointing experience you had with Earthworks Landscape and Maintenance.

I reached out to a few local companies I see around including Austin Landscaping that I know cares for a couple of gorgeous yards that are next door to each other at the corner of Holly and Renwick. Of all the companies I met with, Claire who was the lead designer and also turned out to be an owner, spent over an hour with me at the initial consultation. She answered every question I had as we discussed the likely outcome of each plant that had been damaged or was just not looking so hot.  I was torn between removing everything and trying to design around what might bounce back. The advice I got from Claire was thorough and I in no way ever felt pushed to redo more than necessary. She seemed genuinely concerned about each different plant and had several different design options for every area we looked over.  After much consideration I decided to go with her recommendation of completely redoing areas that were most damaged and really out of date and just refurbish other areas that were not as high on my list of priorities. Although there was some coming and goings due to the plant shortages and it took longer than I expected, she kept me informed why and allowed me to make changes to my plant options based on how long I wanted to wait for a new stock to come in.

When he hired us a second ‚Ä¶From the first time this man hired us it was not a good match for us.  He is often verbally abusive and very difficult to work with as the first project we did for him in 2018 was a terrible experience for us.  When he hired us a second time to do some minor improvements to prepare his home for resale I should have gone with my first instinct which was to pass on the job, however, I like to give people second chances just like I would hope they would with us when we do not preform perfectly so we scheduled his work according to what he ordered.  From the two months worth of rain, we started the spring with a 6 weeks backlog.  After working very hard to find him optimum annuals on two different occasions when there was a dry spell and getting the work scheduled, he rescheduled due to travel plans.  Then when he was ready again to have the work done there were not seasonal annuals that we felt were high enough quality as they had been too waterlogged and informed him he we would have to wait until some better ones were grown.  When the rains finally stopped we had an enormous backlog of orders, over 60 major projects, but we made sure to keep him one of the first orders in line.  Unfortunately they had to start on his project at the end of a work day and he was furious about that (keep in mind this is only for 15 flats of annuals and mulching the beds).  Then when they showed up on the following day Saturday to finish, they did not bring the colored mulch he wanted of which I profusely apologized and explained that it is uncommon for people to want black mulch and we would dump that mulch elsewhere and have to get the black mulch as requested, no problem and it was not an argument, merely a comment in an email.  He also then asked for more  annuals than that one his initial estimate and when they couldn't bring them immediately because we had to go find more of them, again more fury on his part.  When I emailed over the invoice he commented that the mulch was not thick enough and the crew did in fact take it to the house one street over from him and I again profusely apologized.  However,  he continued to be ugly and verbally abusive. The crew went back several times to add more but the gate was always locked.   And honestly we were deep into 100 projects and it fell off my list.  Then I suddenly get a strange email saying that the check had been taken by the postal workers and sent elsewhere but that it had been under the mat for several weeks?  At this point, I began to assume this man is not a stable person.  We are not perfect and often make mistakes, however, we always correct them to the very best of our ability. We also never asked to be paid until these mistakes are fixed.   At any point he could have focused on the positive aspect of his experience because if you drive back by his house now 4 months later his flowers look outstanding and it took us over 2 months to be paid with no complaints on our part.More","reply_to":"101005097521506575780|0x8640e9efafbb5ee3:0x731c03a2a53b4f77"},"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Norman Stalarow","external_id":"117690520964933790217","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117690520964933790217","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":0},"text":"I have been using them for over 17 years and they do a great job and very reasonable.

We could not be more impressed with the courteous, knowledgeable,  prompt and friendly demeanor of these guys.   They listened to our desires and they had many suggestions, also.   Jay, their horticulturist, really listened to what type of plants we wanted and took into consideration of what would grow best in each part of the yard due to shade or full sun.   We met Jay at the nursery and he showed us many different plants and explained how big they got, when they bloom, what colors, etc.   Aside from the three gentleman referred to above, Byron's whole team, from the office to the crew, were helpful, polite and professional. They checked our sprinkler system, re-arranged our pavers and added more pavers.  They leveled our fountain and replaced the pump.\nLaid all new grass.

The estimate they provided was very detailed. It showed their experience and level of attention which showed in their work. This entailed demolishing the previous fence and then planning, digging and pouring new footers for each post. They carefully placed the posts in a way that would allow for as straight a fence as possible given the uneven ground and tree roots. They selected high quality cedar and pine wood. Their craftsmanship was very even and consistent. I was impressed at how quickly they worked and how clean they left yard after they finished. It's obvious that Patrick and his team are conscientious and diligent even in the smallest of details. The final price of their work was exactly as they estimated. Even though it wasn't the lowest bid we received, the price they charged was fair, and the end result was well worth the cost. You get what you pay for!

He showed me some pictures and what his ideas were and I gave him the go ahead to move forward. They would be completely digging out the two front flower beds and just tilled the back flower bed since it isn‚Äôt more than a couple years old. Anyway, the other major part of the job was replacing or replanting the plants in the front and adding existing plants that had died recently from some construing in our backyard. Honestly, the flower beds don‚Äôt look bad, just immature right now, but I am worried about quite a few of the new plumbago he planted as well and the Japanese Boxwoods we repurposed as a hedge. Overall I wasn‚Äôt blown away by the plants he brought - they are pretty and they are definitely the same plants we spoke about planting, but all of them were a bit younger than expected which isn‚Äôt ideal for January.\nAll that being said, what rubbed me the wrong way the most was the fact that while we intended to keep and replant the Japanese boxwoods, we didn‚Äôt necessarily have a specific plan for the other 2/ 3 of the plants in the front that were being removed and replaced. Regardless, I came home one day and all the ‚Äúextra‚Äù plants had disappeared one afternoon (I.e. they had been taken without my knowledge). We did talk previously about specific plants to move to the backyard, but I was shocked when $100s of plants had just been taken without even making sure it was ok with us. The fact that we weren‚Äôt going to use them immediately doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre up for grabs. We have plenty of friends and  neighbors we were planning on giving them to since I‚Äôd estimated that the plants that were taken cost several hundred dollars in total. I‚Äôm sure there were some that couldn‚Äôt be saved, but for the most part they were all healthy plants.\nLastly, and to be fair I didn‚Äôt bring this up specifically, but when they showed up on the first day it was a crew of 1‚Ä¶typically a small crew arrives so i suppose that‚Äôs what I was expecting. The real issue here is that because there was only one worker, it took him an entire work week as opposed to a 1-3 day job had there been a crew. We have two large dogs that weigh over 100lbs. which was inconvenient that our backyard was off limits for that long.\nApologies if this was too long-winded for everyone, but to wrap it up, Desmond is a like-able person l and, made good suggestions, and seemed to know what he was we talking about; that being said, some of his actions didn‚Äôt sit right with me and for how long the project took I was not able to expecting to very tiny to be more than just average .","rating":2.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"109086914767121962364|0x8640c610fb54b62d:0x18d1c7ec419dbcb","media":null,"created_time":"2024-01-17 10:03:30.869729","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Teddy Parker","external_id":"106481489632712976564","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106481489632712976564","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106481489632712976564|0x8640c610fb54b62d:0x18d1c7ec419dbcb","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:03:30.869729","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Ness Addict","external_id":"115844444495568985195","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115844444495568985195","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":3,"photos":0},"text":"As much as I hate to write this, I only feel it fair to provide this feedback to anyone selecting a landscape designer via review standings. As another said, things started out great with Desmond. We reached out and he contacted us to schedule a consultation. He arrived on Friday early evening for the consultation and was on time. We discussed several different options and he explained what his plan would be should we choose him for the project. We were more than satisfied with our meeting. We had two additional companies scheduled the next day for a consultation as well. We wanted to have comparisons, but we enjoyed our meeting so much with Desmond we thought we had found our company. Well, as all things happen as they should‚Ä¶this was no exception. I was to send Desmond a text that evening with my email so he could send the quote. Well, Fat Fingers Freida here types in the wrong number, so little did we know he did not receive the information. We reached out on Saturday and he took the call and my husband provided his information for the quote, Desmond said he had it and would send it right over. Here we are on Monday and have not heard hide nor hair from him. I did reach out yesterday via text requesting the quote if he would still like to be considered and nada, zip, zilch back. You think you connect with someone, you feel comfortable and secure in having the confidence your gut caught the right vibe‚Ä¶when BAM! right in the kisser! But all things will and always do end up for the best. We have our new plan in action and are so very excited!!  The overall cost is substantially less and now we are being allowed to be a bit more hands-on, as we wanted. We want to be a part in the transformation of our home, not just stand on the sidelines.

Reasonable price for excellent results.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114703033252981147227|0x8640e6170709a3d1:0x34446ff3e1115e4f","media":null,"created_time":"2023-12-18 00:03:31.552524","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2023-12-12 10:31:58.412851","text":"Thank you, Debby!!

The estimate he promised in 48hours after we met and paid $250 for, my wife had to bug him for days to get the estimate.  Before we let him do the whole property, we wanted to see his work just in the back yard.  Prior to starting, I walked him to the work area and asked to please be careful of the irrigation pipes and wiring.  Not only was his work very sub standard, 1/2 inch of mulch, root balls above grade, larger plants choking out and killing smaller plants right beside them; but he cut my irrigation lines.  To add insult to injury, he hung the cut lines on my fence and said it was like that when he started.  The company does not respond to my phone calls, my texts or my emails.  The bill to fix the irrigation was $375, I asked him to pay it and I would not post a bad review, naturally I never heard back. Let that sink in folks and do not hire this fraudulent garden company.  This picture is my irrigation wire left hanging on my fence, the only text I got during this ordeal was him saying it was like that when he got there, then he said he showed it to my wife which she denies.

Consulting me if they had any questions.\n1 - Very poor communication. It‚Äôs started with not letting me know that Ground Guys (GG) contacted 811 to mark any cables in the ground (I lock my back gate so 811 couldn‚Äôt get in my backyard to mark any cables). When I contacted the office (the day that started working) they assured me it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Well, it was. GG cut my fiber cable giving me no internet or TV for 4 days because that is how long it took AT&T to come out & fix it. GG agreed to pay the $100 that AT&T was charging me. I spoke with Ryan about the 4 days I was down & asked for a discount to compensate me for the 4 days being down (Also informed him that I talked AT&T out of charging me the $100). He said he would speak with the owner & get back with me. When he did get back with me he said GG would knock $100 off my over $10,000 bill. Less than 1% discount hardly made up for the 4 days. When people look at my yard, say how beautiful it is & ask who did. I will tell them but would not recommend them.

It wasn‚Äôt a far reach to assume they broke that as well. Maybe our patio is so messed because they finished it once the sun was down.

The ‚Äúowner‚Äù Mark is the most inconsiderate, intolerable, inconsistent, person I‚Äôve EVER encountered professionally and personally in my life. His communication skills (when he finally finds time to contact you even with just a very simply question or idea asked etc) are absolutely bizarre, to say the least. The responses he sends through text which you‚Äôd expect a very easy, simple, response to ends up being pages long that at times just turn so confusing and start not making sense, and as if he‚Äôs overcompensating for something, or trying extremely hard to be a people pleaser that it will make you VERY uncomfortable and anything BUT pleased in any way. I cannot stress how unpleasant, and difficult, and just flat out unprofessional his ‚Äúcommunication skills ‚Äú are when hiring this person to complete a service he was hired for, and always pushes you to spend more money than you budgeted even throughout the process of the job! Insanity! You could even call it harassment ! He being a much older and not the most physically fit to be offering the services he and one other crew member he has makes the project last MUCH longer than anticipated and planned for. Also because of his constant bizarre, almost as if drug fueled (highly suspected drug use) inappropriate, and aggressive constant even MORE EXPENSIVE changes he tries to continuously make during the project you can‚Äôt help but feel completely taken advantage of by this persons disgusting, blatant, GREED, and disregard of the clients TIME,  CONTRACT, FIRM BUDGET to spend on project from day 1 to continuously, daily, having to basically remind Mark because HE thinks something would look ‚Äúprettier‚Äù or whatever other colorful words he likes to use, that it is NOT in the budget, and to stop excessively trying to get every last penny he can for himself by issuing these tactics of greed. Lastly, my husband and I first hand witnessed , AS WELL AS NEIGHBORS , an absolute temper tantrum this 60 something year old man threw as if he were a CHILD not getting his way about something. It seemed to be something his poor only employee who is the ONLY good thing about this ‚Äúcompany‚Äù named Bryan who apparently didn‚Äôt do something to Marks absolute insane, petty, disgusting abuse of power as a ‚Äúboss‚Äù that honestly was the (can‚Äôt stress enough) smallest, tiniest, unimportant and served no point in the project or process other than to basically abuse his role as the ‚Äúleader‚Äù and make Bryan feel anything but pure undeserved abuse and negativity ! Then speeds off in his truck screeching tires IN OUR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD in the middle of the day with children and people all about in the roads.Which was blatantly obvious his way and, sick reasoning to leave Bryan alone to complete loads of work all by himself in the hot sun all day long while he childishly, and unprofessionally leaves the job because obviously he just isn‚Äôt capable, equipped, high on drugs, or just plain too lazy to successfully be a leader, manager, mentor or owner of this company anymore! By the way! Still waiting on the final invoice to be sent so we can pay for the services that were provided by BYRAN, the foreman, and only actually working employee of this company. It‚Äôs been literally WEEKS and every day or every other day Mark sends a 9 page text explaining he will have the final invoice sent by the end of the day, filled with complete blatant nonsense and lies. We want to just pay this person so we can be completely DONE with Sienna Landscaping and the worst nightmare/experience with a ‚Äúowner/ contractor‚Äù we have ever ever experienced in our lives. After speaking with several others in the community and neighboring ones who have hired this company all mentioned a lot of the same troubling experiences we had in close comparison to what they too endured by hiring Sienna Landscaping.

BADLY!! I am surrounded by trees that wait for you to clean a little and then drop all their leaves at the same time. I think that they think its funny.lol. I went to google to find help, and came across Harmony Landscaping. Gave them a call, and then to my surprise they were available to come by the next day for a quote. YES! I usually get told next week by most. They were very punctual, friendly and accommodating. They walked and itemized the property, pointed out exactly what i was thinking. They started right after i said yes. Thank goodness cause I was kinda worried with how bad the leaves took over. Within the hour they had made a huge difference, and they were able to clear the roof which hadnt been done in years. The sun began to set and they told me that they would be back tomorrow when there was more light. They arrived bright and early the next day, I was shocked cause i didnt even know they were here. They knocked it out of the park. They cleaned all the leaves, mulched, and cut the grass along with the entire roof. When I saw the yard I was amazed! Hadnt seen my roof in years, didnt know my flower beds could look so nice up front. It gave me a clean start on my planting and so happy that I found them. It gave my neighbors something to be jealous of. Reasonable prices, hard working, and waits till your happy with the job. They take great pride in the work they do, I am really happy with the work and super excited to work with them as I will have more projects in the future. If you need the best look no further.

Great customer service ( which I found very hard to find with other landscaping companies I contacted). 2. Professionalism: Luis and his crew excelled in this area. From the moment Luis came to my place, he demonstrated professionalism, knowledge and understanding of my needs. His crew did an excellent job and was very professional too. One of the very first things I was impressed with Luis was the fact that while discussing the tree options for my patio, I mentioned one tree that I love and he pointed out that this tree could be toxic for dogs, he did that because he saw my 2 doggies that were in the window when he arrived to my place; I said, wow! that is a very high knowledge and concern for the landscaping selection of a tree. Kudos to him. Additionally, he promised the estimate by the same day in the afternoon and he delivered it as he promised, again, kudos! The estimate was sent with all the specific details, he didn't leave anything out and was presented in a professional format. The job done by his crew was great, all the details I wanted and they left everything in perfect order. All the plants, shrubs and tree that Luis brought are beautiful and fresh. What a pleasure having worked with D & G Landscaping design. The patio turned out exactly the way I wanted and I love it! I will hire them again without hesitation for any landscaping work I may need.

Joseph was responsive, professional, respectful and easy to work with. He understood what we wanted through our in-person consultation and seeing a couple example pictures from Pinterest. He was able to adjust the items on the quote as we decided what to include and cut out in order to meet our budget. Their crew arrived on time the day we were told they would start, and Joseph was there to confirm a few details before starting. I watched them meticulously cut and measure and find the perfect side, size and fit for the stone border. They were very fast and efficient, while still producing high quality work. At the end of both days they thoroughly cleaned up everything - even spraying off my kids swing and untwisting it for us!  Our yard was basically a blank slate to begin with, and they knocked out the entire job in two days - one day faster than scheduled!

In December 2021, we sent out notifications to our valued customers, including yourself, informing them of this change in scheduling due to factors such as seasonal variations and rising operational costs. Additionally, we provided ample notice regarding the upcoming price adjustments, allowing almost three months for our customers to plan accordingly.We understand that adjustments in pricing can be challenging, and we appreciate your loyalty as a long-standing customer.

I‚Äôm sorry your experience was not the typical customer experience. First off, although it doesn‚Äôt happen frequently cut lines do happen. We can only go by what is marked and often the lines we encounter are not buried to the depth as they should be. Nonetheless, the cable was cut and subsequently repaired.  It was not buried after the cable provider ran new cable as they could not connect it to the junction box because there was active bee infestation in the box. After the bees were cleared we did return to bury the cable and adjust your mulch at no additional charge. We greatly appreciate your feedback and am disappointed you feel you did not receive the customer service we have delivered for the last 35 years. Thanks again.

Sure, you can hire an individual who is looking to make a buck to do the work, but you won't receive the service and comfort level of knowing the job was done right and backed by a licensed irrigator. 10/10 times I will use Phoenix for my landscaping needs.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104312423770798258457|0x8640b1003675889d:0x193d97036ea6c903","media":null,"created_time":"2019-12-09 07:04:02.086215","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Justin Holder","external_id":"118143132156661950066","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118143132156661950066","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":0},"text":"Great, reliable service with fair pricing.

We wait because we want to see how things look and hold up after a small period of time. Anyone can write a positive and euphoric review immediately after the work has been completed and everything looks great - but how will it look over a small period of time and more importantly, if it doesn't hold up - how will the company behave when asked to honor a warranty commitment? That's what matters most.  Why? We have been trying to resolve warranty issues with ADI for over 4 months due to scheduling, but mainly because he simply doesn't want to just do as promised and replace what has died and repair what came out poorly. Much of what we paid his firm to do, we have now had to replace ourselves and just today found out from him that he is apparently not going to honor the warranty on the trees he planted. $800 per tree according to him. Which is a hint - there is no warranty with ADI. It's just words to sell a project. We have wasted so much time chasing Hector to honor ADI's warranty that we have simply had to punt and replace things ourselves - all while in the middle of selling our home!!!! If we could give this company less than 1 star, we would. He'd rather argue and blame the customer. We paid ADI approximately $18K for landscaping services and various plants. Despite being told that we had a warranty, we have fought with Hector to replace trees that we have since learned from 3 (three) different arborists were not planted correctly and nor were the water settings appropriate for the irrigation (set by Hector himself). Hector told us numerous times that the trees were not getting enough water and heat was an issue (etc, etc), at the same time the Texas A&M educated arborists told us that the trees in question had essentially drowned in the clay \"bowl\" that they were sitting in. Hector, by the way, implied that these A&M educated arborists didn't know what they were talking about, and that he knew these things. This is what they teach at A&M and while we are not even fans of the school, let's face it, they know plant sciences better than most in our area. All of them told us that how the trees were planted and being watered that they were drowning due to how they were planted. The water was essentially pooling in the clay bowl around them because the clay wasn't removed at sufficient depth at the time of planting to allow the water to pass through to be absorbed around the roots. One was \"suffocating\" in the fabric wrapped around the root ball that was never removed prior to planting. We have replaced almost 80% of the flowers planted by ADI within the first 90 days.The outdoor cover we hired ADI to build for our pool equipment and generator was flawed (see pictures) from the start and the wood used was cracking and warped at the time of installation. ADI did NOT finish the project. We are thousands of dollars ($5K to 10K) out now.  For anything related to trees, hire a Arborist - Tree Solutions of Texas. The pictures say a lot. \"Do not use A.D.I Landscaping you will be very disappointed\".

She told us she left on good terms with the previous contractor but that didn‚Äôt seem true as several contractors stopped by while we were working to warn us that Lindsey would likely not compensate us for all of our work. This is all so bewildering, because Lindsey repeatedly told us how much she liked the work.

As anyone can see, our company receives glowing reviews because we go out of our way to make our clients happy.

They were also incredibly friendly to my husband and me, but also to our young son which meant a lot.\nThe landscape architect on our job was a creative genius.

While returning home one day I saw a neighbor having a beautiful fountain installed and pulled over and asked the gentleman working hard on it ‚Äúhey can you make a bocce ball court?‚Äù  His immediate response was ‚Äúare you thinking oyster shell base?‚Äù   Touchdown ‚Äì this guy knows what he‚Äôs doing. Turns out it was Scott Chester who over the course of the next several weeks worked with my wife and I along with landscape architect Harry Dill to come up with a magnificent redesign of our entire front entrance and surrounding landscape.  Our house with its renewed curb appeal will continue to improve as the stunning plants, shrubs, flowers, and herbs mature and bring years of beauty ‚Äì and even more special ‚Äì low maintenance!  We added sprinklers to keep the garden growing and state of the art LED lighting to enhance the visual during the evening hours.  We have a fantastic brick paver entrance up to new stairs and custom made iron hand railings as build by David Lindsey and his son under Scott‚Äôs direction.  Scott is a tremendous talent and he cares.  I mean he cares big time ‚Äì he stayed late into the evenings, used his skills in making sure the drawings were exactly duplicated in the actual landscaping and checked it not once but twice and three times.  He is a perfectionist and yet still a joy to work with!  What I liked about Scott was he was direct ‚Äú we are not the cheapest nor are we the most expensive‚Äù and he even gave us a line item detail of what his plan was and even suggested that we ‚Äútake my quote and go get comparison quotes.‚Äù  Are you serious?  Who does this anymore?  Just somebody who knows what they are doing and stands by the quality of his workmanship and confident in his capabilities.  After about two months since install was complete sadly we had a few plants that did not make it.  Scott replaced them without even a question.  That‚Äôs who I want to work with.   Oh, and I did get my custom made bocce ball court‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and it is beyond what I expected ‚Äì a work of art for sure. Ultimately the garden is for my wife and I to enjoy ‚Äì but it is nice to hear ‚Äúhouse looks beautiful‚Äù as the neighbors walk by.  I highly recommend the crew at Five Star Landscaping of Houston with Scott Chester at the helm.  Work together and you will not be disappointed.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"109315857438960307396|0x8640c16b337fe01b:0xbe5abb188ed057ce","media":null,"created_time":"2020-06-18 12:03:34.715610","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2020-09-10 09:43:40.976699","text":"Hi Bill, hope you‚Äôre enjoying your bocce ball court!

Many company owners will sub out the work to cheap bidders so you don't always know what you are getting quality wise.\n- Competitive price and expanded the scope of our project with no additional costs to us\n- The pool deck refinish came out great\nCons:\n- Attention to detail was not what we had anticipated especially after multiple conversations about how much of a perfectionist he is\n- Works on his own time and not on the homeowners. Some people may be ok with strangers going in and out their properties whenever they want but we weren't ok with this and ended up canceling plans and having to postpone things because we were waiting on Cameron.\n- Lack of focus and time management which led to bouncing around between the different areas we needed completed instead of completing one before the other or completing something while paint or a sealer was drying instead of leaving location.\nI hired Five Star Pavers to do a small project in my backyard with cleaning/sealing an existing flagstone paver patio, refinish some areas of my pool decking and some caulk and mortar work around the coping of my pool. Based on some reviews I had read on Google I hired Cameron because he offered a competitive quote and I read several reviews of him being on site doing the work in many cases. I figured if he took the time out of his day to be at the jobsites then he must be take pride in his work. He arrived on time the first day and after the first day the scope of the project grew to include a new coat of paint and sealant on the entire pool deck due to the rest of the deck no blending in with the refinished area. This added to the expected length of the project due to the extra work which was not an issue.\nMid project there was a family emergency that pulled alot of time away from Cameron which is understandable. The issues arose due to communication gaps about when he would be at my house and the length of time he'd be there to take care of the remaining work. Plenty of days he wasn't at the house until between 9-10a and was gone before 3p. This was before the family emergency and even after the emergency a simple text or call letting us know he had other things to tend to would have solved all these issues but those were few and far between. On occasion he left while things were drying or compounds needed to cure. During this time there were other tasks that could have been worked on during that time to make the overall job take less time. We never knew exactly what time he was coming back and on several occasions I came home early from work with the intent to meet with him and he was no where to be found or had already left for the day with no notification to us. I do not have a work from home job so I took that as a sign of disrespecting my time.\nThe job that was originally quoted at about a week (after the scope expanded) ended up going on for over 2 weeks. The work was never fully completed because several areas required some rework. I will say that he does seem to genuinely care about the quality of his work and was willing to come back to repair the issues my wife and I found but ultimately we decided it was better to move on and complete the unfinished areas ourselves.\nNegative\n\nPunctuality\n\n\nServices\n\nPatio paving, Paver sealing, Hardscaping","rating":2.0,"likes":3,"external_id":"117142921905945666979|0x8640cd4edf8174b5:0x91b9e0e0cad2d08","media":null,"created_time":"2022-12-06 16:45:49.506165","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2022-09-28 22:02:49.379739","text":"First things first it was not a family emergency it was much worse and you know that Benjamin.

Next I ‚Ä¶First things first it was not a family emergency it was much worse and you know that Benjamin. I will keep all of the personal details out but you know what you are dismissing as a family emergency and you really should be ashamed. Next I would like to say I am proud to say that I do all of my work on my projects my hands are what makes my company it has always been that way and will always stay that way. i do my work in house no subcontractors and I personally put my hands and name on every project. I do work on my own time yes,I‚Äôm not ashamed of that I am a business owner not a employee that‚Äôs how buisness works. That being said I always show respect to my customers as well as to there time and schedule as I did for you. I told you from the beginning that I usually arrive between 8:30-9:30 and I was on your site before that time frame each day. . I‚Äôm on my job sites everyday to meet my mark for each day and that is what I did and do.Next to correct the statement of the project taking over 2 weeks  I quoted the job to take a week originally then we had a increase of scope of work I clarified that this would increase the predicted time frame anywhere between a few extra days to a week and I got the job done in 9 days. Even though I made you aware of the increase In time frame you began pressuring me about being done after the third day of work, and again  at the one week mark. I made you aware of the few things I didn‚Äôt have time to get to before you were trying to shoo me away with a check that i didn‚Äôt ask for. I pointed Out the detail work that i wanted to come back for and I honored my word and written warranty. I communicated with you throughout the project and after. I did exceptional work even you said so.On the day before you had a temper tantrum I came early in the morning at about 7:15 worked for a few hours and then had to go help my family with the tragedy stated above. I had told him I would be back shortly and I did come back shortly, and finished what I had to do. Now as far as the statements about time management and efficiency you really should learn that maybe you don‚Äôt know everything and there is reason and logic to decisions I made and make . You made statements such as I could have worked on other things when the coating was drying Ext but yet you did not consider that‚Ä¶. I would have to be working In the area where the coating was drying. Also the lack of focus statement is outlandish because what I do on a regular basis everyday takes an excessive amount of heightened focus you act as if you know what your talking about but you don‚Äôt. materials such as mortar, paint and sealing  have temperature requirements and with 100+ temperatures everyday I had to hit my task in a specific order to meet those temperatures requirements even your wife knows that. Do you not remember her telling you to stop talking because I have to get done with the mortar before it gets to hot to work with?.As to your statement that you decided to do the work yourself,call it what it is I had everything done and consistently offered to do what was left after your temper tantrum. I had to seal one small section of flagstone less then 10 square feet due to some adjustments to the sprinklers done and touch up the paint where I removed excess caulk which I was offering to do even after you acted so immature. Now lastly BENJAMIN let me make this clear to you BUCKO you not only disrespected me and my time but you also disrespected my wife‚Äôs by how you acted during and after as well as dismissive nature of how you classify what happened during your job. you do realize during all of this I was helping my wife and three children deal with what happened without showing all of the pain stress and turmoil and I honored my word and  honored my warranty and will always do so.

Minimize upkeep and maintenance (watering, replacing plants from periodic freezes). Mike took this vision and ran with it, and the results speak for themselves (see before/after pics).

The results were amazing and well beyond our expectations.  The entire backyard is beautifully designed and landscaped with a waterfall, boulders, perennial flower gardens,¬¨¬¨ lighting, travertine walkways and patio.  Needless to say, we were extremely well pleased with the outcome.\nThe design process started with a precise survey and layout of the house and yard.  Then the Landscape Designer created a plan for the placement of the gardens while at the same time meticulously selecting and placing the waterfall, water fountain, flowers, and plants on a drawing.  We were given the drawings to approve before proceeding to the next step.  In addition, we were given a video that presented a conceptual 3D rendering of the Landscape Plan so we could see the result before the construction began.  This was also provided to the HOA for architectural approval.\nThe next step was construction, which was done with wheelbarrows and shovels.  No mechanized equipment was used.  It involved the movement of tons of boulders, rocks, sand, dirt, and irrigation equipment.  From there, everything was all creatively hand built by artisans clearly in line with the Landscape Plan\nThe final step was preparing the flower beds with good dirt, mulch, irrigation, drainage, plants, flowers, and grass.  Plant selection was well thought out and properly placed.\nHere again, the results were amazing and well beyond our expectations.  And now we get to wake up to see this amazing garden every day.  We give Mirror Lake Designs the highest marks for professionalism, creativity, attention-to-detail, and construction.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103254039719115597293|0x8640cb4b96b8ed81:0xfa749aff14a96462","media":null,"created_time":"2023-10-06 07:53:08.674968","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2023-10-01 21:29:34.714495","text":"Mr. & Mrs McBride, It was a pleasure working for you all and we really appreciate you giving us the opportunity for creating your Outdoor Living Space.

Now we understand Shawn‚Äôs description of a pool as a water feature that that you are able to enter.\nEach construction team worked diligently and professionally, showed up on time, were polite and friendly, kept the construction site tidy and took care to minimize and mitigate any disruption to the  neighbors. Richard had these amazing teams so well-coordinated that they completed the entire project far ahead of schedule, despite these days of labor and material shortages, and they responded quickly to any  requests even after the project was long completed.\nThis is the second time we have used Mirror Lake.  Three years ago they created a beautiful garden for us ‚Äî better than what we could have imagined ‚Äî out of what had been just a rectangle of grass. Now Mirror Lake beautifully incorporated the pool and fountain which we can enjoy every day, whether or not we are actually swimming, and our hypertensive dog now finds herself dozing on the patio to the sound of flowing water.\nThanks again to Mirror Lake!

I now need to hunt for someone else to fix his issue. I was looking for more yard work but will now have to stay away from him unfortunately. I would recommend others look elsewhere too.\nService:\n¬†\nWood fence installation","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104543366992436384829|0x864097d09ccaae0f:0xed03b4513be8c6fe","media":null,"created_time":"2023-07-18 22:03:38.350526","reply":null,"attrs":{"Critical:":["Professionalism","Responsiveness"],"Service:":["Wood fence installation"]}},{"author":{"name":"Tjdarnell X","external_id":"108113324782496739382","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108113324782496739382","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":12,"photos":0},"text":"They left the job before finishing.","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"108113324782496739382|0x864097d09ccaae0f:0xed03b4513be8c6fe","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:03:38.350526","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x864097d09ccaae0f:0xed03b4513be8c6fe"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Amy Ditta","external_id":"110418049914832126611","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110418049914832126611","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"Wonderful job and always help with extra's removal/taking Christmas tree, help moving things when I couldn't lift them and hauling away as a favor.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"110418049914832126611|0x8640e966b7f83a83:0xbabc2fefb520f54b","media":null,"created_time":"2017-06-19 12:03:38.363951","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2020-06-18 12:03:38.363951","text":"Thanks for the review, Amy!","reply_to":"110418049914832126611|0x8640e966b7f83a83:0xbabc2fefb520f54b"},"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Ian Ramsay","external_id":"106011628748675410835","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106011628748675410835","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":5,"photos":0},"text":"Llamas Landscape Management continues to provide excellent landscape management services for my property and has done so for the last 5 years.

Not specifically this location, but I tried to warranty an 18in Husky toolbag with extended handle and wheels. I have replaced it before and not given so much trouble as this store has. I dealt with Customer service rep Nick. He's telling me how they can not honor the product warranty replacement. Even though Home Depots website regarding warranty explains it all. I asked to speak with a manager Jerry Cobb. He would not talk to me or swing by as other managers do. One main responsibility they have is to keep continuing shoppers to continue purchasing. Home depot is the one that informs me that this particular brand offers warranty in the 1st place. When purchasing tools and supplies we look warranty whenever available. What kind of customer service is this? Previous store at Silverlake would have honored, they just did not have any in stock. Their online inventory should 4 in stock, but we could not  locate any, and we looked multiple aisles.

So I hung up on her but she needs to be put on check!\nNegative\n\nProfessionalism","rating":1.0,"likes":3,"external_id":"117943215300286629563|0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32","media":null,"created_time":"2023-05-31 10:36:55.358019","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"David Armando Larios","external_id":"106394788080690018686","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106394788080690018686","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":4,"photos":57},"text":null,"rating":4.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106394788080690018686|0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32","media":null,"created_time":"2023-02-03 14:44:02.754226","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Miguel Hernandez","external_id":"103856153811498095697","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103856153811498095697","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":37,"photos":14},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103856153811498095697|0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:03:38.547054","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"hugo adrian Carmona","external_id":"108955229668206642973","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108955229668206642973","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":13,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"108955229668206642973|0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32","media":null,"created_time":"2022-04-18 03:42:43.035388","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Rick Steinhart","external_id":"114036663598390792405","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114036663598390792405","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":3,"photos":0},"text":"Positive\n\nResponsiveness, Punctuality, Quality, Professionalism, Value","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114036663598390792405|0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32","media":null,"created_time":"2022-01-27 18:40:37.520836","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Rigo Garc√≠a","external_id":"113712882585406407194","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113712882585406407194","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"113712882585406407194|0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32","media":null,"created_time":"2021-06-18 12:03:38.547054","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Jesse Plascencia","external_id":"106520592638474133398","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106520592638474133398","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":6,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":3.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106520592638474133398|0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32","media":null,"created_time":"2021-03-19 17:16:30.035461","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESYENBRVFDaHBDUTJrNFNVRlNTVzVEWjI5QlVEY3lTV2g0YTJ4T0xWOWZSV2hFWWxNMFZYQmhTakkyU0hwUWNtUmtaMEZCUVVGQlIyZG1YMEZ2YUhocmJFNHRSMEZCYVVGQg==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x8640c3ac9d181209:0x707bd46ce69dcd32"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Color Gravity","external_id":"103721473902089811590","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103721473902089811590","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103721473902089811590|0x8640c252b5ae3ef3:0xc968fe8a98ded08f","media":null,"created_time":"2018-06-19 12:03:38.554357","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"USA Lawns, Inc.","external_id":"104222576953209382575","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104222576953209382575","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104222576953209382575|0x8640c252b5ae3ef3:0xc968fe8a98ded08f","media":null,"created_time":"2018-03-01 18:04:56.282555","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x8640c252b5ae3ef3:0xc968fe8a98ded08f"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"chanie c","external_id":"100010724535043655006","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100010724535043655006","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":7,"photos":0},"text":"Had this company do our community for 8 years.

I recommend them to anyone looking for tree care.\nWhen I called for service, they sent Justin to my home within a few days. I have two 40-year-old live oak trees in my backyard. I explained my requirements, and he gave me his recommendations. We agreed on the terms, and in a few weeks, they performed the service. They trimmed both trees to the agreed expectations. They even handled a few extra issues for free that we had not discussed.\nThey used electric and hand tools to trim the trees rather than gas-powered. That may not be the case for every service, but it was nice not to listen to a 2-stroke engine all day.\nWhen the job was complete, they invited me to review the work with the crew chief to ensure I was happy.

Using professionals for both services was indeed a first experience for us.  While working with both Chris (manager) and Travis (owner), they clearly explained their services, scheduled a home visit and provided an estimate.\nUpon my approval for the work to be performed, Fernando and team (Jose, Tim, Mario) arrived and went to work beginning with cleaning our windows - inside/outside, including all 3 levels - and performed the necessary touch ups as needed.  Next, our holiday wreaths/garland were hung & lights were added onsite to help ensure that we did not have any ‚Äúdark spots‚Äù in the yard.  After a few hours, our home looked absolutely beautiful and ready for the holiday season‚Ä¶AND, by November 30th!  :)\nI truly appreciated Shine of Bellaire‚Äôs design work/support, quality of products used, professionalism and friendliness.

In late June 2021, we did the installation and were told that we did a good job. He paid us in full. We created a punch list of items immediately afterward to make sure he was completely satisfied. July 2021 was a challenging month because it rained most days and crews could not work. The client sent in additions to the list of items to be corrected. Our crew went and corrected the punch list and those additional items on 7/29/2021. The client was always understanding and complimentary on the phone and in person about the completion of the project. Only via email and this review did we learn anything otherwise. We have continued to offer to make things right including spending almost an hour on the phone with him to understand his issues. He considered our offer but has decided to refuse our help.

However, he completely disregarded our budget when creating the plan.\nConcrete Work: 5 Stars Jesus installed a beautiful patio for us and worked easily around sprinkler heads and drains within our backyard. I would absolutely employ him again.\nPlants and Installation: 2 Stars When grass was installed, the ground was not leveled. As a result, our grass is now completely uneven and water pools in some places. The plants are of poor initial quality, made worse by the fact that the ground was not properly prepared prior to planting: the existing clay was not amended with soil, sand, and fertilizer, as recommended by all gardening experts, including the Texas A&M Ag Extension. Only a very thin layer of mulch was spread over the beds.\nMany of the plants arrived damaged with broken branches and are struggling to survive after only 8 weeks, and we have already had to remove 4 dead trees. Herbs I added into our yard from Buchanan's have outgrown the plants VLD installed after only 2-3 weeks.\nOverall, our yard is much better off than it was before, but at the price point, it leaves much to be desired. We have reached out to Andoni about these issues multiple times, but he refuses to acknowledge that any corners were cut. He has, however, agreed to replace plants that die in the fall, which is a small consolation for going $2800 over budget in a 20 ft by 20 ft space.","rating":3.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102568813459252193634|0x8640bf2b999447a1:0x9dd8b90cc08fd1bf","media":null,"created_time":"2021-06-18 12:03:40.018465","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x8640bf2b999447a1:0x9dd8b90cc08fd1bf"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Supercute Baby Lucas","external_id":"109191516272871892131","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109191516272871892131","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":155,"photos":6345},"text":"Special thanks to architect Edward Wong for designing Houston Gelato Cup.

He was very responsive, flexible, not pushy, and had my best interests at heart (working with what I already had at my house to maximize results within the budget), and I loved that he had a positive attitude. He got back to me with a quote shortly, and I needed to make some changes, so he came back out again to talk it over with me.\nMy house is over 40 years old so this was no easy project to add 165 feet of yard drainage, clean up, level and grade my courtyard to maximize drainage, and clean up the garden beds in front that had been very neglected, in addition to grading some other areas.\nIn total, the project took 6 days. Eduardo's foreman, Enrique, and his 2 team members were sweet, polite, and very hardworking. Enrique is a perfectionist, and put my mind at ease because I knew he understood my vision and was going to execute it to perfection. Enrique is very detail oriented, and took the time to answer all of my questions and explain to me the process of the project. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their work as it is very reflective in their quality. They also left my house cleaner than it was before they came, haha. And, payment was easy.\nI couldn't be happier with the results. It is better than I could have imagined, and most importantly, I now have great drainage. I would recommend Klein Landscaping 1000% and would go with them again in a heart beat! Thank you so much, Eduardo, Enrique, & team!","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103228032492649039507|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2023-09-17 18:03:40.116879","reply":null,"attrs":{"Positive:":["Professionalism","Quality","Responsiveness"]}},{"author":{"name":"santiago Aguilar","external_id":"107540581760770909363","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107540581760770909363","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":170,"photos":71},"text":"Very well nice landscaping  and the best prices\nFine all you need","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"107540581760770909363|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2023-06-18 12:03:40.116879","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Dao Hien","external_id":"114278528634866558771","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114278528634866558771","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":4,"photos":71},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114278528634866558771|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2020-06-18 12:03:40.116879","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Kushman Johnson","external_id":"111816803010621641409","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111816803010621641409","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":13},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"111816803010621641409|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2020-05-27 00:35:53.717325","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Manuel Ramos","external_id":"102517058690645654935","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102517058690645654935","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":38,"photos":2},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102517058690645654935|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2018-06-19 12:03:40.116879","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Rosa Lopez","external_id":"103580709742621503923","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103580709742621503923","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103580709742621503923|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2018-02-16 15:42:12.105535","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Pat Aguilar","external_id":"111063665502908948763","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111063665502908948763","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":15,"photos":9},"text":"Beautiful work!","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"111063665502908948763|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2017-06-19 12:03:40.116879","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Chris Menjivar","external_id":"106547487865397071022","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106547487865397071022","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":51,"photos":136},"text":"Nice flowers","rating":4.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106547487865397071022|0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05","media":null,"created_time":"2017-01-02 02:19:31.546807","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x8640c93b85a406d1:0x1b59b2d4d981cc05"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[{"name":"product","external_id":"/m/01jwgf","count":3},{"name":"rain","external_id":"/m/06mb1","count":2}]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"wildcat 4235","external_id":"115206301419070195437","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115206301419070195437","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":6,"photos":0},"text":"Alex and the whole crew made this such a great experience.

I asked them to make the area look nice and cut out the dead branches and clean up the bed that the tree was in. They hacked off the only nice parts of the bush, planted some cheap flowers, failed to remove the banana tree they were supposed to, and never put the mulch in the bed they promised. They had left over sod that I paid for and didn‚Äôt use it all. They sold that to my neighbor and never even offered me a discount.

To me, clean equipment is the first sign that a company cares about their line of work.

And, let me premise this review with the fact that it pains me to have to write this, because I knew Corey before I came on with the company and always respected and looked up to him as a successful business owner and friend.\nDuring my brief employment with him, sadly many things were afoul. First, I was never paid for the hours I actually worked and when I was paid, it was few and far between‚Äî although he stated from the beginning pay was every Friday, this was far from the case.\nI saw workers come and go. I saw day laborers also come and go and not get paid for the total hours worked. The way he treated his workers regarding pay was highly unethical.\nAs a friend, and as someone with compassion and understanding during the whole Coronavirus debacle, I initially told him I would allow him to catchup and that I knew he was good for the money. Little did I know, Corey would use this to ultimately take advantage of me. While he did pay me occasionally, leaving me enough for groceries and gas, my bills began to pile up and the amount he owed me began to venture closer and closer into the $3500 territory. I finally had enough of being taken advantage of and concluded my employment with him, ending what used to be a good friendship.\nI can‚Äôt stress enough how disorganized Urban Organics is. It‚Äôs obvious he has major issues tending to his bookkeeping, but the jobs were always unorganized. Tools and supplies were always unorganized, often with things missing. Jobs were all heavily delayed because of the major disorganization. And, the morale and smug treatment of his workers was appalling. I‚Äôve never been barked at so many times for simply asking job related questions that were not clearly conveyed. And, I‚Äôve never been hung up on by a boss as many times as I have by Corey. He may put on a charming front with the customers, but when it comes to his employees, he‚Äôs simply downright disrespectful.\nBuyer beware. He may actually finally deliver the product he tries to sell you, but I‚Äôm telling you now, if you hire this man, there‚Äôs a good chance your project will be delayed for weeks, maybe even months. And, given the fact that he treats his employees like garbage, well‚Ä¶ use your own judgement there on whether or not you want someone like that performing work for you.\nI would never in my life recommend his services to anyone.\nNegative\n\nResponsiveness, Punctuality, Professionalism","rating":1.0,"likes":5,"external_id":"108422027327071321946|0x8640c1a6c7bd8539:0xa5870e7762ee8fdf","media":null,"created_time":"2021-06-18 12:03:40.931672","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2021-02-12 03:04:19.078680","text":"We're sorry you feel this way.

From the start, their team was professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated to providing top-notch service.\nThey expertly trimmed my trees during the ideal season, ensuring the health and longevity of each tree. The crew used sharp, clean tools and made precise cuts that maintained the natural shape of my trees. They also removed all dead and diseased branches, significantly improving the overall appearance and health of my landscape. Their careful approach to thinning out crowded branches allowed more light and air to reach the inner canopy, which has already made a noticeable difference.\nThe lawn care services were equally impressive. They mowed my lawn to the perfect height, avoiding the common mistake of cutting too much at once. Their watering strategy was spot-on, ensuring my lawn received the right amount of water at the optimal times. They applied a balanced fertilizer that has noticeably enhanced the lushness and color of my grass. Their proactive approach to weed control, including the use of pre-emergent herbicides, has kept my lawn virtually weed-free. The annual aeration service has significantly improved the soil health, and their mulching around trees and garden beds has helped retain moisture and suppress weeds effectively.\nOverall, exceeded my expectations. Their attention to detail and commitment to quality is evident in every aspect of their work.

My entire fence had fallen down onto my neighbors car and after I explained the criticality of the situation (Having a dog and 2 kids) and needing it to be fenced in, they were able to put me in front of others based on needs. They were happy to call their other customer just to see if it was even possible to help me. Less than one week after the storm and fence blew down, our fence looked amazing.
