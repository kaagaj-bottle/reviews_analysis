Choosing Everest Destiny Treks was definitely the best decision. Rameshwor is truly a professional who absolutely answered all our questions very quicky and concisely. He was always a phone call away on WhatsApp. What I appreciate the most about him is his human side of trying to get a better comprehension of what we really want and how we can experience this trek with peace at heart.\nUpon our arrival in Kathmandu, we met Nawaraj who is the brother of Rameshwor. He ensured that our journey to the hotel went smoothly and that we had all our equipment needed. We bought some of the equipment from Tamang Trekking Shop and you will be amazed by its owner, Mr Ram who is the epitome of kindness. Rameshwor and Nawaraj became our bhai from Nepal and I am so grateful to that.\nPema Sherpa and Vikram accompanied us during the 12 days of the EBC trek. Pema bhai made us laugh so much and Vikram bhai never ceased to amaze us with his courage. I was lucky enough to celebrate my 30th birthday at Phakding and for that I am full of gratitude. They even baked me a cake and sang me Happy birthday. For one moment, I was not missing my family on that day.\nRameshwor and Nawaraj introduced us to their generous family where we were lucky enough to experience their way of life and to live a one day full of traditions on the last day of the Dashain festival. They even give us tips on how to navigate the crazy Nepalese traffic like a local. After 1-2 days, we know all the road going through Thamel by heart.

From the moment I met Devraj, my guide, I knew I was in good hands. His warm and welcoming nature instantly put me at ease, and his knowledge and passion for the region made the entire trek to Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) a memorable adventure.\nThe trek was meticulously planned, with every detail taken care of by Devraj and the team at Nepal Alibaba Treks. From arranging permits to organizing accommodation and meals, they ensured I had everything I needed for a comfortable and enjoyable journey. Devraj's expertise in navigating the trails, combined with his deep understanding of the local culture and environment, enriched my experience beyond measure.\nOne of the highlights of the trek was the incredible hospitality I received along the way. Whether it was the cozy tea houses or the warm smiles of the locals, I felt welcomed and cared for throughout the journey. Devraj went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and well taken care of, always ready with a helping hand and a friendly smile.\nThe trek to ABC was challenging yet rewarding, with breathtaking views at every turn. Devraj's encouragement and support were invaluable, especially during the more difficult sections of the trail. His stories about the region, the mountains, and the people added a unique and personal touch to the trek, making it an unforgettable experience.\nReaching Annapurna Base Camp was a moment of pure joy and accomplishment. Standing amidst the towering peaks, with the crisp mountain air and the stunning scenery all around, I felt a profound sense of gratitude for this incredible journey. It was a dream come true, made possible by the exceptional service and guidance of Devraj and Nepal Alibaba Treks.\nIn conclusion, my solo trekking adventure with Nepal Alibaba Treks was a remarkable experience that I will cherish forever. Devraj's warm service, expertise, and genuine care made all the difference, and I highly recommend Nepal Alibaba Treks to anyone looking for an unforgettable trekking experience in Nepal.\nThank you, Devraj, and the entire team at Nepal Alibaba Treks, for making this journey truly special.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"117792707921383921499|0x39eb19d97d9989d5:0xcfa6a546fc76ece4","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-26 01:20:12.747483","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-05-24 19:24:41.937835","text":"Thank you so much for your wonderful review!

From the moment I contacted them, they were nothing short of excellent. They were incredibly responsive, promptly answering all my questions both before and during my trip. We originally chose a tour which included a trek to Dhampus and Sarangkot, but we wanted to modify the itinerary and ended up adding several days at the start and during our tour. This was no problem at all and our itinerary was easily changed to suit our needs.\nDuring our time in Nepal, we had several guides and drivers. In particular, Resham, Pradip and Ranjeed were amazing. All were professional and friendly and helped make our trip even better. Each guide was so knowledgeable about Nepal and happily answered our questions. On the trek, we were so well looked after. Our guide Pradip and helper Balaram did everything they could to make sure we enjoyed our trek (even though it was more challenging than we had expected! )\nWhen a flight was cancelled during our trip, Resham quickly organised alternative arrangements for transport, hotel and new flights, alleviating most of the stress of the situation.\nI highly recommend Luxury Holidays Nepal's services to anyone seeking friendly, efficient, and reliable travel assistance in Nepal. Thank you for making our journey stress-free and enjoyable!

This way you can be confident in yourself and not be bothered too much if some of the symptoms appear.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"114302463728380388979|0x39eb19dc6b89df3f:0x10c1c61aab0ef462","media":["AF1QipP2oiWH_Rj_CaFOhoUBXPbvSwiK6pNHlaQpq2v8","AF1QipN8MXPoXuhDC_2qmvqeLgKOho6LBhHlCZSwrH-A","AF1QipOtaawptzxKawktlfySTmkVwDFmjM8PaeIZTywJ","AF1QipNwSIQXs3lArnyuqY8ojdkUeQaVhHzt-0vpeGic"],"created_time":"2024-06-12 12:51:41.865368","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-06-16 07:26:49.229395","text":"Thank you so much for joining us for the Everest Base Camp Trek this spring 2024.

This was my first trek in Nepal and had very less idea about how things function there. Since I had gotten their reference through a friend, I was quite at ease and went ahead relying on them for all the logistics.\nRight from my arrival in Kathmandu - how my stay panned out, to figuring out last minute stuff, everything was a bit chaotic. If I am going to a new country for a high altitude trek, I will make sure I‚Äôve all my gears and stuff in place - where the agency comes into play and makes sure that I have everything. But it wasn‚Äôt the case with me. I was running around Thamel area trying to locate stores to buy stuff. But I kept calm and didn‚Äôt react to this.\nTwo days into my trekking I was told that they overlooked my itinerary and I‚Äôll have to adjust my stay based on the schedule that they were going to follow. Which meant staying additional nights at different locations; and was informed that I would have to cover the expense (which obviously I denied later). Since I was with a group of climbers who were going ahead for their expedition, I was pretty much following their itinerary till the very end. The guide who came along with me was a 20 year old boy for whom it was the first trek in the Everest region, and had no clue about the route or safety. I was even asked to share my room with a porter/staff since they wanted to cut cost.\nBecause of their negligence and unorganized processes- I was left with only one day in the end to spend in Kathmandu after returning from the trek. I can go on and on about how poor the over all experience was but I‚Äôll pause here for now. Please feel free to reach out in case of any questions.

On the other hand we wanted to support the local economy so we decided to take a guide. I was expecting Gaurab to just show us the way but he was so much more. He looked after everything else and just left us to concentrate on the trek. He took us on paths that independent travellers missed and was able to give much more context to the trip. If you've heard that much of the Annapurna circuit is now following the road, that would be from travellers with no guide. After about ten days Gaurab was able to find us a Porter at short notice as we'd decided that would actually add more to the enjoyment of the trek. And it did. In the end the journey was about these people we met and not just the things we saw or places we visited. We gained so much more from being a little team and our guide and porter were integral to that.\nIn the organisational stage Ras was responsive and knowledgable which helped enormously in the planning. I will be contacting Enjoy Nepal Treks for any future Himalayan ventures.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"110215496143278030628|0x39eb1be14e03e45f:0xd327dbc5005f433b","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-18 02:51:42.917259","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Oe Tkj","external_id":"104305648985289246458","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104305648985289246458","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":80,"photos":6},"text":"Excellent next-level service.

Nepal Trip Planners crafted an immersive experience, guiding us through ancient temples, bustling markets, and vibrant streets that resonated with the heartbeat of the city.\nBandipur, a hidden gem, offered a delightful retreat into the past. The cobbled streets, preserved architecture, and panoramic views were a testament to the town's timeless beauty. The transition orchestrated by Nepal Trip Planners from Kathmandu to Bandipur felt like a journey through Nepal's diverse historical and cultural chapters.\nPokhara, a jewel cradled by the Himalayas, was a picturesque blend of adventure and tranquility. Boating on Phewa Lake, marveling at the Annapurna range from Sarangkot, and exploring the city's vibrant markets showcased the versatility of this enchanting destination.\nMankamana added a spiritual dimension to our trip, with a cable car ride leading to the sacred temple. Nepal Trip Planners ensured that this experience was seamlessly integrated, offering us a glimpse into the spiritual richness of the region.\nChitwan, with its lush jungles and diverse wildlife, marked the perfect finale. Our encounters with rhinos, elephants, and an array of bird species during safari adventures orchestrated by Nepal Trip Planners left us in awe of Nepal's natural wonders.\nDespite the unpredictability of travel, the team exhibited remarkable adaptability, ensuring that our itinerary remained a harmonious symphony of experiences. The guides, with their expertise and passion, not only enriched our journey with knowledge but also shared the untold stories of each destination.\nIn essence, our Nepal adventure with Nepal Trip Planner Pvt Ltd was a masterpiece of exploration, combining historical richness, cultural diversity, and natural splendors.

From the first contact and communication to the last day of the trekking tour, everything was perfectly organized and easy going. Even a common dinner with Temba and other members of the organization in Kathmandu before the trekking was possible. I also particularly liked the fact that we first spent a few days in Kathmandu sightseeing and then started with the trekking tour (three passes tour), so I could already acclimatize a little bit and get into the Nepalese culture. Our guide was very well equipped and could answer any question and knew the region very well. He was flexible and we also could realize some adjustments on the tour. Even when I had some little health problems (stomach), he took care of me in the best way. The porter was also very reliable and treated our things very carefully.

Ltd. It perfectly arranged my trip without any doubt. First of all they frequently  contact me to know how I was doing and nicely responded during trip. They even re-arranged the hotels within the short information because suddenly I had physical problem due to high altitude sickness at the Jomsom . So I had to re-book next hotel fast at lower areas but thanks to them, they already had booked the hotel . Tourist Guide is very-very experienced. He was well educated about mustang and even knew about the on going construction works which may had caused a huge problem if he wasn‚Äôt there . He drove  us to the dhumba lake early in the morning it was a perfect timing for photo shot.

It was really fun and exciting to travel with you. Mustang is often called the heaven on earth because of its unique landscapes and scenic beauties.

The travel agency was very patient with us in setting up the trek with name. New Era Holidays prepared a totally exciting itinerary for us. They helped us in hotel reservations, our transfers from and to hotels and airport. We had a really experienced guide. He knew everything and I mean everything. He was knowledgeable, candid and humorous. Best guide ever!!!\nWe flew to the Lukla Airport. The landing part was such a breathtaking experience. I heard it was one of the most dangerous airport in the whole world. From there, we hiked and hiked and hiked all the way to the EBC. Namche was such a wonderful city. It had cafes, restaurants, bars and the important of all, internet. The way to the base camp was much more fulfilling than the base camp itself. We had views of the Everest, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Cholatse and other unnamed peaks. By the end of the trip, the people here seemed like a family.

I had a trekking package booked with the New Era Holidays people and it sure was amazing. I went to Pokhara, Ghorepani, Poonhill and the Annapurna Base camp. The service was top class, guides totally experienced and really candid. The guide gave us description about every little detail of the places. The New Era Team made everything easy for us. We were greeted and welcomed every place we went. In Pokhara, we experienced such amazing views, the Phewa Lake, the mountains, the views. The most scenic place I‚Äôve been to. Then, those really hard stone steps, so difficult (I really need to workout a little). Our major destination held so many views of the mountains. We saw the Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, Gangapurna and something called the Himchuli.\nNo complains about the trek. It was all perfect. I really would like to change some things though. I would definitely spend some more time in Pokhara and Kathmandu. Both cities were so special. One had the Phewa Lake and all scenic views one would ever wanna wake up to. The other had so many temples and old structures. It was like living in a prehistoric area. One suggestion for my fellow travelers; the sales persons are really annoying. They just come to you and cling onto you until you buy something or you don‚Äôt want anything.

Responses like yours really lift our spirit and encourage us to work even harder in the future to make the trips even more fun and satisfying. Our primary purpose has always been to facilitate people who are trying to explore the rich and diverse landscapes of our country and offer them packages which suits their palate and their pocket. With the beautiful array of some of the tallest mountains in the world sitting along the northern (Himalayan) border of the country, some of which have the most exotic and breathtaking flora and fauna and lakes and gorges known to mankind, trekking in Nepal basically sells itself. It is not a coincidence that ABC has been regularly featured as one of the best trekking routes in the world, which is not only because of its breathtaking natural, scenic beauty but also because of the rich cultural and religious experience it offers along the trail. And the fun and excitement you gain while exploring culturally rich city like Kathmandu and lake city like Pokhara in Nepal are just icings on the cake.....Having said that, it always falls under the duty of  any trekking company to make sure that they get the smallest of details right and that the trip of the client is as hassle free as possible. In that regard, we do take even the smallest of complaints of the customers very seriously so that mistakes do not repeat in the future. So in your case, if you ever wish to do this again, we would make sure that you get some extra days to explore Pokhara and Kathmandu and also have our people create some space between you and the annoying sales people.Hope to hear from you soon and would like to promise that we would make your next trip even more fun and exciting if you ever wish to do business with us again.

This was my initial visit to Nepal, my first trek of this magnitude as a solo traveller. I was introduced to Ramesh through a friend, and the experience didn't disappoint. He orchestrated every aspect, from airport pickups to pre and post-trek accommodations in Kathmandu, trail lodgings, and meal arrangements. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about a single thing, which was a blessing.\nWe trekked to Gokyo Lake, with an ascent to the Renjo Pass at an elevation of about 5,360 meters‚Äîundoubtedly the highlight of the journey. Yet, every segment of the trek was mind blowing, beyond what I could have anticipated.\nBeginning the journey solo, I later had the fortune of connecting with a group trekking around the same time, arranged by Ramesh. This blend of solo and group experiences added a unique dimension to my adventure. Making new friends on the trail, I appreciated the thoughtfulness and consideration shown by both my guide and Ramesh throughout the journey.\nRamesh‚Äôs passion for his work and extensive knowledge were evident at every step. His commitment to ensuring a well organised trek and providing the best local support made the entire experience remarkable.\nI felt completely taken care of, which was invaluable, especially during physically and mentally challenging days. The presence of good people around you truly enhances the beauty of the journey.\nIf you‚Äôre considering a trek in Nepal, and seeking a well organised adventure with exceptional local support, I wholeheartedly recommend reaching out to Ramesh and trekking with Community Trek. I can't wait to go back again!","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102200823069099051899|0x39eb1bc110111565:0xc0f55800cf6de3f5","media":["AF1QipNE7nGFDhyVahkr0y-zYnlmi6LGnS5s5SweBGZm","AF1QipPYW48eCRVPo-MzmmvxY-G6MSf3SxAAQzDh8ckR"],"created_time":"2024-01-17 10:51:43.668341","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Leanne Kruger","external_id":"105254499618774212863","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105254499618774212863","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":"We have had the pleasure of travelling in Nepal with Community Trek on two occasions.

Their regular check-ins ensured our safety and comfort, showcasing a genuine dedication to their clients' well-being. The accommodations provided were commendable, offering a comfortable retreat after long days of trekking.\nThe true gem of this adventure was our guide Gyalpo Tamang Dai. His exceptional level of care and support went above and beyond. His attentiveness was remarkable, even going as far as carrying our utensils and, incredibly, carrying a friend suffering from high altitude sickness on his back. Without his unwavering support and expertise, our trek would have been immensely challenging.\nThe trek itself was mesmerizing, offering breathtaking vistas of Langtang Valley and the magnificent Tserko Ri at 5000m.

Goshh, I got goosebump and speechless. Overall I really appreciated and give credit for the great assistance from Himalaya Trip starting from Harka that always help and answer my questions with patience eventhough unexpected date changing at very last minutes, outstanding guidance from Jay for his patience and continuous support for giving us the best experience during the trekking, and Umesh who assist us to carry our stuffs.

It was invaluable for us to have a contact in Nepal and he was very accommodating and quick to respond.\nOnce we started the trek, again with above and beyond hospitality, our guide Jay and our porter Surpa were friendly and always willing to answer questions and share information with us. They were great trekking guides, and always acted in a safe and professional manner. You could tell they had a great deal of experience both on the trail and with clients. I felt very comfortable with them and their friendly company made the experience so much better.\nAlso, having the logistics like pick up and transfer to Pokhara, lodging, and permits taken care of for us was very convenient.\nIn terms of cost, the time and hassle saved, as well as the assurance that you are safe should something happen (which it easily can in the mountains), is I believe, worth the money.\nI will gladly do future trips again with Nepal Hidden Treks.

This is very important for such an adventure.\nMartina and Christoph","rating":5.0,"likes":2,"external_id":"100097320296216841321|0x39eb18fcd720dc31:0xe8dab4e6175b7dae","media":["AF1QipPbLgsT-gS4p7P5HQie8uq7rY8Kx6Lqg8rzeipG"],"created_time":"2024-05-11 08:54:10.809064","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Shehzad Bharuchi","external_id":"118141109283650179712","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118141109283650179712","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"I went to Nepal for trekking with Outshine Adventure, it was an awesome time and taking care by the team.

If you only read this far the company is fantastic, blew expectations out of the water and you should use them for your next trip.\nCommunications from the very beginning were timely and informative from Gokul and his team, within 12 hours we always had a response to any inquiries we had which made us feel in good hands. Upon arrival everything was seamless from pickup to briefing the days ahead. Everything you possibly needed from currency to SIM cards was thought of and helped with. Asmita, checked in routinely to ensure that the trip was going well and to see if anything was needed which it never was because everything was already thought of.\nThe highlight of the trip without a doubt was the trekking, but not just the beautiful mountains, amazing towns, forests and jungles, the main highlight was our guide Shom and our Porters Harka and Barbrom. Shom knew the land and rivers but more than that thought us about local customs, Buddhism, Hinduism, traditions, as well as song and dance and so much more. Every single day was laid out for us and if there were any issues or discomforts he would ensure it was taken care of.  We never had any doubts with Shom that we would not make it over the mountain pass, he always went well beyond what was necessary going out of his way to ensure everything was always perfect. Harka and Barbrom were always there giving a helping hand with a smile on their face and a few times saved us from forgetting some pretty critical items at a tea house! There‚Äôs really not enough good to say about the three guys.\nIn addition to trekking we had some additional days and Outshine lined up a trip to Chitwan National Park for us. This was a great short trip that again was added to our overall trip without any hiccups or issues. We enjoyed a great safari jeep tour and canoe river tour viewing beautiful animal and plant life. Our guide and accommodations again were excellent.\nEvery bit of this trip, the drivers, the hotel staff, the guides, Gokul, Asmita, was and is 5-star worthy.  You are cared for and everyone is genuinely kind.","rating":5.0,"likes":2,"external_id":"116616619421105984191|0x39eb18fcd720dc31:0xe8dab4e6175b7dae","media":["AF1QipMgq18E4JtUCVxiNokQCANYttvYkjDTewJsQu0h","AF1QipNASGa0YU3RZVkWqz1NpkxdbrUYQSnN4APj5KJT","AF1QipMxtW-qlRYVy0C9kX70B3N1KEQXGzpEBR6e8VvT","AF1QipMgtLrNVhKKJx-xiqlysj8sWOqX5rIaiGAmLu6V"],"created_time":"2024-04-10 10:11:41.560500","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Ivan Javier Flores","external_id":"116963337630601699557","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116963337630601699557","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":0},"text":"Excellent agency\nThe experience was excellent, the organization did not fail in anything, both the flights and the hotels, the safety and suitability of the guides, this agency is highly recommended to see an incredible place, natural beauty, I recommend Asmita who takes care of everything so that it is a dream trip","rating":5.0,"likes":2,"external_id":"116963337630601699557|0x39eb18fcd720dc31:0xe8dab4e6175b7dae","media":null,"created_time":"2024-03-18 06:51:43.905426","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Anna Middleton","external_id":"107118226596661711991","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107118226596661711991","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":"My sister and I went on a trek with Outshine in January.

Also I really liked we got to meet Anisha, our guide for the trek, the day before going on the trek.\nTrekking: Anisha showed us the local way of traveling on our way to the start of the trek. We absolutely loved being directly immersed in Nepali culture and travel at the start of the trip (in stead of staying in a tourist \"bubble\"). This included our backpacks being strapped on top of the bus, people hanging on to the bus, school kids joining the ride for a few miles, and 10 boxes of chicklets loaded into the bus being delivered in the villages. Lovely being able to observe and participate in it all from the front seats on the bus, reserved for us by Anisha to fit us tall Dutch people. 10 hours in stead of 6, but totally worth it.\nWe really loved the way Anisha sought to adjust the trip to our whishes and preferences, and also adjusted her communication style in the way we like it. It is as if we where traveling with a friend who knows the area well, rather than a guide, that was very pleasant. I loved how quickly we became informal, and we laughed so much during the trip.\nI really liked hearing some of the \"back\" stories, about the medical doctor taking care of the people hurt by building the road and how the road that is under construction may affect the trek and all the people in the area. Anisha showed respect, balance and care in addressing these issues with us, a responsibility she seem to take at heart. It felt really lovely to be able to talk about such matters with her.\nI noticed at times where it was more difficult for her as a woman to be a guide, this made me respect her even more in the job she is doing. She is so strong, both physically as well as mentally. She is breaking gender barriers in her work, and I do not underestimate how difficult it must be for her. She has to proof herself so much more than her (older)male counterparts, but does so outstandingly well.\nWhat I liked overall is that we could adjust the plans to our wishes and preferences. For example, we're happy about the decision of not having a porter. We have been thinking about this, should we have a porter or is it not necessary? With the information we received we could make a good decision on what to bring (and what not), making it doable to carry everything ourselves. No regrets, it is perfectly doable if you have been trekking with a backpack before. During the trip we discussed the day plans, and Anisha was very helpful in making adjustments where we wanted and to discuss the options. In the end we did almost exactly what was planned in the itinerary, but we felt we had a say in that and we enjoyed thinking along and thinking ahead.\nWe met Sajana when we where back in Kathmandu and were very inspired by her organisation, her story and all the other projects she is doing.

Udaya our trekking guide and fellow photographer, and Chirring our porter were so much fun to hang out with, in addition to being very experienced and capable guides who took care of everything, including us, very conscientiously, and from whom we learned about the cultures, culinary and medicinal plants, connected us with the people living there, etc. which added meaning and depth beyond just trekking. We played cards, told jokes and laughed a lot.

You should go for a Muktinath tour package. I have planned my trip for 32 family members for a  days journey from Kathmandu to Jomsom for Muktinath stay  via Pokhara, which was done thoroughly. I would like to thank Shivalaya Holidays for this excellent service. The hotel accommodations in all the locations (Kathmandu, Jomsom and Pokhara) were well designed with vehicle services for city tours also. The off roading journey from Pokhara to Jomsom was a bit challenging due to some of my family members being older yet the Shivalaya team handled and planned everything beautifully, for a smooth and memorable experience. Communication and details were very clear from day 1 making us feel safe and supported. Our yatra wouldn't have been seamless and fun without their support.

Our tour package with Shivalaya Holidays took us to Kathmandu, Pokhara and Chitwan and it was a lifetime experience. We started our journey with a breathtaking sunrise view from the mountain followed by a thrilling 1 hour flight to see Mount Everest. In Kathmandu, we explored the Pashupatinath Temple and Heritage Durbar Square and watched the Tharu culture dance in the evening. The next day we went on a jungle safari and saw unique animals which was a surreal experience. We then headed to Pokhara where we stayed at the Utsav Himalaya Hotel and enjoyed boating on Fewa Lake and visited the Gupteeshwar Cave. Throughout our trip Shivalaya Holidays ensured our comfort with their excellent bus, vehicle and facility services. The staff and guides were all very good.

After traveling to 45+ countries I can honestly say this is one of the most authentic cultural experience I have ever had, in any country. I walked into their office and met my wonderful travel agent Sabita on day 2 of travel, gave her a fixed budget and she made the best out of it. When my trip to Pokhara was cancelled due to weather, I was immediately rebooked with a monastery trip on the same day with adjusted itinerary, so I didn‚Äôt feel bored. Every day Sabita made sure I have a full day of itinerary at my request. My driver Guvinda speaks very good English which made my pick up very easy (I stayed at a very difficult area), he was able to pick up/drop off at my place of request without issues. Always came to work with a smile. Cared for my safety. My guide for 2 days, Anup was very knowledgeable and patient with me. All around a good guy! We are at the best Newari places at very fair price. My office agent Kabindra is also very patient when working with me. My cooking class was hosted by one of the senior guide‚Äôs wife Saveena and we had such a good time visiting local markets and just talking about life. Oh did I mention my mask painting class, wood carving class and my Everest mountain flight? 10/10 will chose this honest travel agency again. If there‚Äôs 10 stars I‚Äôd honestly give it to them.

The pickup location for the Jeep on the paper you gave us says ‚ÄòChabil Samaj Dental Hospital‚Äô, which you have to get to independently for 4:30am. If you type in Samaj dental hospital into Google it takes you to the wrong place about 15 minutes away from the actual pickup, we had to deal with this in the morning and it was very stressful. The full address of the pickup (as of May 2024) is ‚ÄòOm Samaj Hospital, Dhobi Khola Bridge, Gopi Krishna Marga, Kathmandu 44600‚Äô.\n2. ‚Å†I was told that the jeep journey is to Puiya when it is actually to Thamdanda (approx 45 mins walk to Puiya). My recommendation for the company is just tell people it is to Thamdanda to avoid any confusion.\n3. ‚Å†I was told the Jeep can take us to Puiya in one day, having been on the jeep I believe it is almost impossible for the journey to take one day. It takes between 8-10 hours from Kathmandu to Salleri and then between 6-8 hours to Thamdanda. We planned for one day, it ended up being 2 days and it affected our trekking itinerary which we had to adjust\nPrice\nThe price is more expensive with this company, 3,000 NPR for the jeep to Salleri from Kathmandu and 3,500 NPR for the jeep to Thamdanda from Salleri.\nIf you can book the jeep service independently, the price should be 2,000 NPR from Kath to Salleri and 2,200 NPR which I found out from someone once in Salleri and it is what I paid on the return journey also.\nComment on the jeep service which I don‚Äôt think is something World Himalayan Destination can influence as it‚Äôs a public jeep service that anyone can book onto:\nThe jeep service itself is tough. It‚Äôs a long ride on very bumpy roads in a very cramped space. The jeeps typically don‚Äôt leave until full which is 10 people including the driver. In my opinion the jeep should have a maximum capacity of 8‚Ä¶it get so packed and cramped it‚Äôs very uncomfortable. Unless you can communicate in Nepalese it‚Äôs difficult to know when the breaks are, how long you have per break, when the jeep plans on leaving, how many people will be on the jeep etc\nPositives:\n1. The jeep will get you from Kathmandu to Thamdanda in 2 days just don‚Äôt expect it to be a comfortable journey\n2. Compared to flying to Lukla, the jeep is cheaper\n3. The workers at WHD are friendly and try to help\nHopefully this review will improve the service or at least prepare people for what they are getting into to :)","rating":3.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104746790187417220919|0x39eb18e3220d277b:0x58524eb93f428c2e","media":null,"created_time":"2024-06-12 12:51:47.313297","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-06-12 01:43:40.824132","text":"Dear Jishnu Thank you so much for your review: Kathmandu to Phaplu Salleri via Buspa Paiya. ‚Ä¶Dear Jishnu Thank you so much for your review: Kathmandu to Phaplu Salleri via Buspa Paiya.

About the price we clearly mentioned on our google sites it's cost 6500 Nepalese ruppes each. Included Kathmandu to Phaplu Salleri via Buspa Paiya ticket and also government taxes via insurance for the passenger. If people buy a ticket by themselves directly from the road it's cheaper but the taxes and insurance not covering if happened anything on their journey.

We keenly agreed to the idea and Elite Trekkers sorted us transport the next day which took us directly there! Oh my, what an experience the monestry was, I highly recommend a visit here whilst you are in Nepal.\nNow, where this company truly exceeded expectations was during our time in the Langtang Valley.

I learnt an extensive amount about the culture of the people in the valley, the devastating earthquake of 2015 and whilst I am not very religious we got a great understanding of Buddhism which was utterly fascinating.\nI really could go on and on but I swear to you this is the company you want to do your trekking with whilst you are in Nepal.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102741222837063142079|0x39eb1b495003b6a7:0xec95aafa0296ef73","media":["AF1QipMviUQo5puzH4wIUh-5vcqsx-93PoNHl43R2Wb2","AF1QipPe11trUU3_Na6Xd-WZNmPadpW-NuaSxy2LpRGt","AF1QipNVtzHnZ8TAkES8mG6dmlWUFxIzwpF0CXyV5vYF","AF1QipNc1IZGLVEGC6F3N3L-HeXbCinn7Xa36zxe-PvV","AF1QipPMZQTEAhmf3TQMokEGODqMKJfwmN3AQ9KL4vNH","AF1QipOF6DoENgKfuY-V2yukSPY_xUspw9UCpiMUOrLV"],"created_time":"2024-03-30 04:08:10.715520","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Patrick Lohmeyer","external_id":"112806367637588822735","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112806367637588822735","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":12,"photos":5},"text":"From the first enquiry, we felt very comfortable with Elite Trekkers. Mahendra replied to us by email in detail, transparently and always responded to our wishes.

As we wanted to walk in a group, Mahendra also supported us in our search for travelling companions.\nWith Kiran, we had the best guide we could have wished for on our trek. He always took care to our needs and tried to get the best for us. We really took him to our hearts during our trek.\nUnfortunately, we had to cut the trek after 7 days due to illness and missed the Mardi-Himal-Basecamp. Kiran made sure that we got a seat on the bus for the return journey and continued the trek with our other group members at our request.\nWe are really happy we have choosen Elite Trekkers for our mountain adventure and can recommend the company to all :)","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"112806367637588822735|0x39eb1b495003b6a7:0xec95aafa0296ef73","media":null,"created_time":"2023-11-17 14:51:47.379715","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2023-12-18 00:51:47.379715","text":"Thank you for your kind words ","reply_to":"112806367637588822735|0x39eb1b495003b6a7:0xec95aafa0296ef73"},"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Our Vision Nepal","external_id":"100407063795846798218","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100407063795846798218","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":3,"photos":0},"text":"Best and freindly trekking company.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"100407063795846798218|0x39eb1b495003b6a7:0xec95aafa0296ef73","media":null,"created_time":"2023-09-17 18:51:47.379715","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Scott Edwards","external_id":"106625544698674979129","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106625544698674979129","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":3,"photos":2},"text":"My wife and I booked a package with Elite Trekkers for the Annapurna circuit and I could not recommend this company more.

I researched the company before we booked and loved their approach and ethos, and they really made the experience for us. Mahendra ensures all of Elite Trekkers' guides have good English and can provide information on local history, culture and fauna, and we felt we gained so much insight from him during our hike when many other hikers were missing out.

are the people you need to speak with. A group of us spent three weeks travelling Nepal on an itinerary that needed to be spot on as there were no spare days (we were prepared for bad weather but got lucky with great weather). They provided guides and support from arriving in KTM through until we left 21 days later. We paraglided, canyoning, ziplined, chopper flights, hiked 85km over 5 days through Mustang, mountain biked, trekked to Thorong La Pass on the Annapurna Circuit, attempted summitting Thorong Peak at 6144m (poor climbing conditions on the mountain prevented the summit, weather was perfect and our guides had 13 Everest summits between them), more mountain biking, white water rafting, bungy jumping, chopper flights to Annapurna Base Camp and Ama Dablam Base Camp and over Everest Base Camp, finishing with some golf and spare time. This was the best adventure I've ever been on. Jiban and the crew at SNT were simply amazing and ensured this amazing adventure occurred seamlessly.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"105389466509766283876|0x39eb195f1212e015:0x32282458e6bc17ec","media":null,"created_time":"2023-06-18 12:51:47.641800","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2023-05-13 15:17:07.219764","text":"We are glad to hear that your team had a great time in Nepal.

Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we deeply regret that your visit did not meet your expectations, especially when it comes to the quality of your hotel stay.Allow us to address the issues you raised. When you entrusted us with planning your trip, our tour executive provided Ms Shrestha (your representative) with a range of hotel options, including approximately 10 different types of accommodations in Dubai. Ultimately, it was Ms. Shrestha who recommended the CityMax Hotel for your stay. However, it's worth noting that during your travel dates, the hotel had a stop sale due to the peak season in Dubai.Despite the challenges presented by the high season, we made every effort to secure your booking at the CityMax Hotel, as per your representative's request. Ms. Shrestha meticulously reviewed hotel ratings on TripAdvisor and Google and, based on her assessment, opted to proceed with this reservation. It was our intention to make your trip as comfortable and enjoyable as possible, and we booked the hotel in accordance with her preferences.We understand that upon arrival, the hotel's rooms and services did not meet your expectations. We immediately contacted our supplier to explore options for upgrading your room, but regrettably, due to high occupancy, we were unable to secure an upgrade. It's important to note that we had already booked this hotel with a very slim margin, as the costs were elevated during the high season and due to the stop sale.To demonstrate our commitment to your satisfaction, we have provided you with the invoice from our supplier and refunded the entirety of the margin we had initially included. Additionally, we organized transfers to airport from your new hotel location without any additional cost, despite the increased distance from the originally booked hotel.We also offered you the option to stay at the hotel of your choice, even if it meant an increased cost. However, at your request, we explored alternative hotel options to accommodate your budget.

From the initial enquiry to booking, updates and amendments, HL‚Äôs communication was excellent. Having done a little research, and retrospectively compared with other trekkers on the EBC trail, the package offered by HL is very competitive, if not the best value. Our guide, Dawa, was incredible. He was very experienced, knew all the best tea houses, cafes and bakeries, had a great relationship with village locals, guides and porters, had excellent English, a great sense of humour, was always approachable and a pleasure to talk to but gave my partner and I space to enjoy each others company. We always felt safe and well looked after in Dawa‚Äôs company. Most of all, organising this trek with HL and having a guide like Dawa provided us with peace of mind, made the trek so much more relaxing and enjoyable.

Both were wonderful hiking companions.  The trek turned out to be private as we were the only ones signed up.  It was excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a challenging but not difficult trek in the Everest region.\nRaj was extremely responsive and fully answered all my questions as we went through preparations for the trip at home.  Once we arrived in Kathmandu, Raj took us on 2 informative walks through the Old Town area of the city and helped us with exchanging cash and choosing restaurants.\nThe trek itself, as the name suggests, is focused on the sherpa people and their involvement in climbing in the Himalayas.  Raj was a fountain of information about this, as well as the history, geography, and wildlife of the area.  Each day of hiking was very doable.  The lodges chosen by Raj (and the villages in which they were located) in many cases had some connection to sherpas who were famous for their exploits on Everest.\nOne of the reasons we chose Responsible Adventures was their focus on wellness.  They consistently made sure our food and drinks had healthy ingredients.  Sundar was always in the kitchen at our lunch stops and lodges attending to this.\nWhen we returned to Kathmandu, Raj arranged a driver for a day acted as guide for visits to Bhaktapur Durbar Square and Patan Durbar Square, both impressive historical sights to complete our Nepal experience, one that we will never forget.

Raj was patient and responsive to our emails about what to pack and what to expect during the trip.\nResponsible Adventures took care of everything during the trip and we were able to focus on the amazing scenery, people, and experiences. We were met at the airport (at 1 am!) and transported to our hotel to get some much needed sleep. This might seem like a small thing but after 3 long flights, I was grateful not to have to navigate a taxi.\nShrijana, our guide, met us in the morning and took such great care of us up until we departed Nepal 10 days later. She shared a yoga practice with us everyday. It was a wonderful way to reflect on the day‚Äôs trek and to stretch out the tight hamstrings!\nThe food was delicious and geared toward providing our bodies with the nourishment needed. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt so healthy and strong. Dil, our chef, took great care in providing safe water and healthy meals and also hot beverages that warmed the body and soul. (I am still trying to replicate the honey and turmeric tea!).\nOur porters were friendly and sociable, which made me happy. They, without question, out-hiked us but we‚Äôd all meet up for lunch and at the tea house for the evening. Responsible Adventures is one of the few companies who provide meals for the porters and staff. How Responsible Adventures provides for their employees was definitely a factor in us deciding to trek with them. If you‚Äôre searching for a trek, I hope you consider this too.\nThe trek itself was breathtaking. It was challenging in parts but never too difficult. We never felt rushed and often stopped for photos or to just marvel at the scenery. All in all, trekking in Nepal is amazing and Responsible Adventures made our trip one of the best experiences I‚Äôve ever had.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106698873307600559700|0x39eb1939cc10e897:0x42e9c8e34377ee12","media":null,"created_time":"2023-12-10 17:49:34.078718","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Carissa Nettle","external_id":"108657851808053963341","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108657851808053963341","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":3,"photos":7},"text":"Our \"Tailor-made Annapurna Wellness Trek\" exceeded our expectations.

We complained for vehicle not too comfortable, Sumit sir got arranged to BYD EV M3e 7 seater too comfortable. Since the roads travel through mountains and travelling 170km can take upto 5 to 6 hours and with limited number of days for tour we were suggested inter nepal transfer by Airplane. Kathmandu is same of any city with traffic but its outskirts making beautiful places to visit as we were provided even more spacious Toyota High Ace vehicle for sight seeing and the spacious vehicle made us enjoy the sights more relaxing as we toured the city. since my parents age 70 years the tour was planned by Sumit Sir very thoughtful keeping in mind the age factor and less of getting tired for them. The hotels provided i.e. Five elements at lumbini, Pokhara Batika in Pokhara, Hotel Ramada in Kathmandu all were just perfect after the sight seeing to relax and unwind.

We even tasted  continental cuisine which was also yummy. the tour was comfortable and more of flexible as Sumit Sir never denied or objected our requests. even the hotels room were changed on demand as the room allotted were not pleasing.

The answer to that is he wanted all the money up front and stressed on numerous occasions that there would be no refund even if we only completed one day of the 20. This apparently is not normal or reasonable practice among trekking agencies. Only once we were on the trek did we discover the trek route was taking us over two passes that were above the snow line and weren‚Äôt even open for just over another two weeks. We had been set up to fail. Route had to be changed to one that didn‚Äôt need a guide. Terence passed a comment during the trek that he was missing out on another trek because he was with us and so clearly didn‚Äôt expect us to keep going for the 20 days, which is probably what Ganesh had led him to believe. The fee we paid included the guides accommodation and food cost, which they were responsible for. The reality quite different. You are made to stay at lodges where the guide gets free food and lodgings but everything costs you, the client more. Indirectly you are paying twice. On the odd occasion I insisted on choosing the lodge the deal we got was much cheaper and we had an unhappy guide who ate little. To ram home the point we trekked on our own after for 25 days and on only three of those nights did we pay for accommodation and it was minimal amounts. Electricity, showers and wi-fi were normally included as well. We estimate it cost us NPR20000 more over the 20 days because of the way they operate.\nPlease avoid this trekking company like the plague and in general all trekking companies. As of March-May 2024 no rules are being enforced. Routes are normally easy to follow, if not ask. Having trekked with a guide and without, trust me the latter is a much more pleasurable experience and people talk to you more when you don‚Äôt have a guide.","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104225973615112204403|0x39eb18e530d91725:0x4f0b0f3113c4e015","media":null,"created_time":"2024-06-03 12:51:48.296778","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Juliet Wagner","external_id":"116771174339300861666","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771174339300861666","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"When we were first introduced to Ganesh at the tourist office, we were sceptical about how sales-ey the interaction felt, but he patiently answered our many questions, gave us helpful advice and, most importantly, arranged for our excellent porter-guide Krishna to accompany us on our Annapurna trek. Krishna was wonderful: he went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and safe, and was great company. Our trip would not have been the same without him. Some examples: he always chatted to locals in each village for up-to-date directions (many routes were damaged to due to landslides) and gave us more of a connection to the place we were staying; he noticed were keen on wildlife and pointed out distant blue sheep, yaks etc, so we didn‚Äôt miss anything; when we crossed the pass without mini-spikes (tip: in November, they are useful above 4,500 m!), and he knew I was particularly nervous on ice, he gave me his own and went without. There was a bit of a language barrier, but it made little difference, because Krishna was such a generous, fun and competent guide, who really knew the route and the environment.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"116771174339300861666|0x39eb18e530d91725:0x4f0b0f3113c4e015","media":null,"created_time":"2023-06-18 12:51:48.296778","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"nicolas_eco","external_id":"103312326740503871604","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103312326740503871604","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":107,"photos":361},"text":null,"rating":3.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103312326740503871604|0x39eb18e530d91725:0x4f0b0f3113c4e015","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:51:48.296778","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Sarah Matthews","external_id":"111607228596101968354","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111607228596101968354","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":13,"photos":0},"text":"Thank you to The Everest Holiday for such a fantastic time in Nepal!\nGanesh did an amazing job of helping us find the right trek, after the trek we had planned to do on our own was unable to go ahead!\nI cannot say enough good things about our guide Krishna Ram Osti (Sanu).

Since my guide mastered a very limited and poor English I would say, not so good. A lot of times I experienced difficulties of understanding and got irritated a long the way. I had some questions about the rute, time and advice I could use answers to.\nI give it 3 stars because I asked the manager Ganesh in advance for an English speaking guide and didn't get that.

There are already plans for the fall, I have no doubt that the guys from Signature Tours will help implement them.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102937891451260549651|0x39eb19aafdc8893d:0xcf5f589c0cbc2cd2","media":["AF1QipOAFqvScJmxkjY8cBd9OkSAx05GfE5iUjwMm_h6","AF1QipMniyTia1NhPi5TQGiGLFg65VZsIwUIDiAfBgvt","AF1QipOoVuKc-8Kj4p8eW0i713YGmcRAcAS47UQ1w5mK","AF1QipNo28giQKYx-RykgUOGHk9bFYH-iymZ8MiEvz7l","AF1QipOkn3Pj2WI7_1Mm3Ej0eooyoljPkPBw-AEmvkRo","AF1QipM8AR3WZI3PHTQyBIARxRf4c8LNu9NxCoBStvUM","AF1QipNd5patdWBSVLqJTWnV6BNAVj2pb153IZFleUmY","AF1QipPFE8t-GT3k98czO4lqXlvYXWu5eFtk2U6YN3u4","AF1QipNCbaR3Fj4hd8_mGsOc2FbI1UbkoYLezRGw0wrp","AF1QipMVJTaBaqGsnhQPit5yZV07KuXcxW0O-n1hdplP","AF1QipO5spFGAUHIaWvt79v2kpe08PRVeEHVFjXZ1QMk"],"created_time":"2024-05-06 10:11:03.290829","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Tim Turner","external_id":"111141137792905013836","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111141137792905013836","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":"Signature Tours put together a lifetime experience in Chitawan for us on the spot.

Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of visiting Everest Base Camp. When I started researching ways to get to EBC via helicopter, I looked into the different providers and Buddhi was the most responsive and cost effective. He was quick to respond to any questions, yet at the same time thorough and patient.\nFor me Nepal was my 169th country visited. I arrived in Kathmandu from Kabul Afghanistan (connecting via Dubai), and have continued on after Nepal to Africa where I am now at my 173th UN country so 20 more to go. I say this because of course it means I have worked with many good tour providers, as well as some not so good. Most are good, but only a few are great, and Buddhi is as good as it gets. If you want to go to EBC via helicopter, he is your man.\nBuddhi owns the business and owns the customer relationship. He is accountable and transparent. He is responsive and friendly. In essence, he is the perfect tour operator. Buddhi answered all my questions in advance via WhatsApp, met with me the day before my helicopter flight (and bought me lunch), then took me out for a meal in Kathmandu after the tour concluded (at his suggestion and again out of his pocket since he wanted to host me).\nIt was clear to me during the flight process that safety is the #1 priority for the business. During my trip, our pilot was called away to do a rescue mission for an injured trekker so we got extra time at Everest View Hotel. It turns out he is one of the go-to helicopter pilots in the country and used to transport the Prime Minister of Nepal.\nIf you are considering arranging a trip with Buddhi, do it. You will be in good hands.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"101746430618753249944|0x39eb18e5bf1bef41:0xf14a4b773259bc38","media":["AF1QipMeiE6QkB9idYI3gpaOUWeyQohuqsG1rKS0Ente","AF1QipOKE_UVVJb_H0m8nYHnqAovRFgJzozMt0eQzGMy","AF1QipOHj5t-f1gA8McAoDGnq13wKHCAJGYGHws0f9rC","AF1QipO83vKBksyh5f2kE642WEsR1pKHGL6EcUGnTc0R","AF1QipM0_dDahoRIJfODJFJ5ZsOvnaSLuLZyXLeMYUkS"],"created_time":"2024-05-20 12:51:48.927735","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESY0NBRVFDaHBFUTJwRlNVRlNTWEJEWjI5QlVEY3lTRUo1TlRkRGExOWZSV2hCU1RCVmVHOTJPRWx5T1hCUlMyTkpjMEZCUVVGQlIyZHVPVEpRVlVOalNFeHVjMHRSV1VGRFNVRQ==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x39eb18e5bf1bef41:0xf14a4b773259bc38"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[{"name":"guide","external_id":"/m/02p19vy","count":53},{"name":"team","external_id":"/m/011l78","count":39},{"name":"porter","external_id":"/m/011lqk","count":18},{"name":"airport","external_id":"/m/09cjl","count":17},{"name":"itinerary","external_id":"/g/11cmh5569r","count":12},{"name":"altitude","external_id":"/m/0g45f","count":10},{"name":"passes","external_id":"/m/020wcz","count":9},{"name":"smile","external_id":"/m/019nj4","count":8},{"name":"helicopter","external_id":"/m/09ct_","count":6},{"name":"tea houses","external_id":"/m/0ctlxy","count":6}]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"dhwani gandhi","external_id":"109382344172596527382","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109382344172596527382","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":6},"text":"EBC TREK with Trekking planner is truly an unforgettable experience.

The owner Dipak was really helpful with booking the trek, and was very responsive.\nThanks all!!!","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102991890995863080113|0x39eb18fd1eae126d:0xed94e271e5a3fd84","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-18 02:51:48.964684","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Madhumad Pethe","external_id":"101663445055869493134","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101663445055869493134","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"Absolutely well planned ,customized tour.

Dipak, the owner of Trekking Planner, and his team far exceeded my expectations. We were group of 20 booked the Everest Base Camp with helicopter return. From the moment I made my first inquiry with Dipak, I knew I had made the right decision. I extensively researched and reached out to numerous companies both in the US and locally in Nepal. Unlike other companies, Dipak was extremely responsive throughout the process, patiently answering questions and providing expert recommendations based on my personal preferences and goals. Every aspect of the program was extremely well organized and executed flawlessly from start to finish.\nOur trekking guide, Abhishek and assistant guides FT, Diksha,Sumam,Ranjan,Thu Kadai were truly exceptional and went above and beyond to make our trek a dream come true. Abhishek was absolutely meticulous about ensuring every small detail was taken care of from start to finish and was incredibly caring and thoughtful ‚Äì continually checking in on us and constantly motivating us with his positivity and upbeat attitude He provided invaluable guidance on every aspect of our trek ranging from food recommendations to dressing appropriately for the changing weather conditions.\nI can‚Äôt recommend Trekking Planner highly enough. I‚Äôm someone who has extremely high standards and Dipak and his team far exceeded our expectations. Trekking Planner truly sets the benchmark others should strive for with deep expertise is based on years of accumulated experience. I was so impressed with their level of customer service and expertise. I will continue to recommend them and make them my go-to guide service for any travel in the region.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"110064624672517960190|0x39eb18fd1eae126d:0xed94e271e5a3fd84","media":["AF1QipNpj11WOlSTHAS4d-JkDlkW7JDWJa49RF-NOo3f"],"created_time":"2024-05-11 16:36:30.988624","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESY0NBRVFDaHBFUTJwRlNVRlNTWEJEWjI5QlVEY3lTRU5PTFRGa2RWOWZSV2hFTjNGc1RqbHNObk10ZFhSNUxVUmxORUZCUVVGQlIyZHVPVEpSYTBOalNUTTNWakkwV1VGRFNVRQ==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x39eb18fd1eae126d:0xed94e271e5a3fd84"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"deepak khatri","external_id":"101429750002800639223","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101429750002800639223","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":16},"text":"I had a very nice experience with the travel agency.

Super friendly owner and budget-friendly packages make them stand out from others.\nTo continue about my experience- It was first ever trek of my life. Every first time comes with challenges that needs to be conquered. Out of the comfort zone and far from city hassles, the destination was set to Lantang.\nMixed with emotions- overwhelmed to see the mountain from a very close distance and equally nervous as, never had I ever walked such a long distance. Had to be mentally prepared to walk almost 8 hrs every single day for next few days, which was literally kinda out of my league thing. But, the thing that kept me going was the Mountains and, the emotional support from my team members as well as the guide.\nWe reached upto Kyanji-ri lower peak and, winessed the eyepleasing view from the top- must say all the hurdles that we faced seemed more than worth it for the observed serene view.\nNevertheless, the only thing that made the ardous journey easier was the service of Destiny tours and travel itself. A separate guide to help, a good heartwarming place to stay and, an execution of good trek plan- everything summed up in the beautiful experience of my first ever trek- Trip to Langtang.\nWould recommend to everyone. ‚ù§\nP.s.

His expertise, knowledge, and unwavering support were instrumental in making our trekking journey an absolute delight. Anil went above and beyond to ensure that each member of our group felt comfortable and safe throughout the entire trek.\nOne particular incident showcased the exceptional level of service provided by Anil and the team at Destiny Adventures. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, we were unable to reach the originally planned hotel. However, Anil demonstrated remarkable resourcefulness by promptly arranging accommodation for three different groups at three different locations. This thoughtful action allowed us to continue our trekking adventure without any disruptions, and it truly highlighted Anil's dedication to ensuring our comfort and satisfaction.\nDestiny Adventures is undeniably the best travel agency for trekking. Their attention to detail, seamless organization, and commitment to customer satisfaction set them apart from other agencies. From the moment we booked our trip until our safe return, the entire team displayed a high level of professionalism and genuine care for their customers.\nThe Gosainkunda Lake trek itself was awe-inspiring. The breathtaking views, serene landscapes, and peaceful atmosphere truly made this journey a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Destiny Adventures meticulously planned every aspect of the trek, ensuring that we had the opportunity to immerse ourselves in the beauty of the Himalayas while feeling supported and secure.\nI would wholeheartedly recommend Destiny Adventures to anyone seeking an unforgettable trekking experience.

Very Good Job.\nThe company's extensive experience in the area brought us to places that we would not ever have reached on our own in any self made tour and these are places that give us unforgettable photos to send to friends and life memories.\nThere was a lot of support in carrying luggage to the hotel, loading them on the car and helping the staff in such a journey that is physical and requires effort, in everything that required such effort, you feel like a king and everyone takes care of you and makes sure that you concentrate on the trip and the experience rather than the organization.\nFor any problem, the communication with the company was immediate and it was taken care of - for example, I ran out of money and the visa card didn't work and the company organized a solution.\nas a drawback points  - those are related to Nepal / Tibet theirself, i think the last day or the last Leg from Kyirong to Katmandu requires Two days from few reasons - The distance, slow driving due to roads and scenic/view, Border passing issues etc.\nIn conclusion, I experienced a successful deal with a company regarding picking up a huge and unforgettable trip that was not easy at all and the company acted impeccably all along and this is not obvious at all to me.\nThanks for all the Great stuff members, Kumar the manager, Shusma, tour guide, Tanuu the mechainc, The Great and professional Tibetian driver tracked us in the support vehicle, Lakpa the tibetian tour guide and more people participates in the effort to create and perform a great tour that is worth to be a life memory.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104375866392225189676|0x39eb1eb1c6b9ab61:0x1197edcf18f15b83","media":["AF1QipORBDDRAJK1zoi0oYXRwmxlsk2LCt7qXq7MlJ20","AF1QipMHYcvU1xCWYS7utQ18e-W5UgFZDftOw1iwpxCK","AF1QipP6qSTFA1tp09Q9RhKpQyNZ63-xOW2b1aBZiURs"],"created_time":"2023-10-18 04:51:49.654667","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Manoj Singh","external_id":"108569722665544372307","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108569722665544372307","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":5},"text":"Overall, this was a once-in-a-lifetime motorbike tour for us, Upper Mustang riding in the foothills of the Himalayas along the Annapurna range, and the journey and trip were made memorable by Parikrama.

Due to Covid we had no choice but to not travel to Bhutan and Nepal, They gave us the option of cancellation or suspension. We elected not to go as it was a group and others were unsure about future plans. I made the company aware that we intended to go again but due to uncertainty around viability of this company with Covids impact and the length of time before we could go again we were left with no choice but to not go.\nAll other providers fully refunded us even providers who had a no refund policy at booking stage. This included all airlines and accommodation providers both big and small, This firm left us no choice but to accept the cancellation policy charge of 30%. Our tour costs were around $7000 Aus per couple totaling around $28000.\nSurely pure rip off ‚Ä¶. never again .","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102449692173069021337|0x39eb1eb1c6b9ab61:0x1197edcf18f15b83","media":null,"created_time":"2021-06-18 12:51:49.654667","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Debojit Roy","external_id":"108452257412824221865","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108452257412824221865","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"108452257412824221865|0x39eb1eb1c6b9ab61:0x1197edcf18f15b83","media":null,"created_time":"2020-06-18 12:51:49.654667","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Raman Roy","external_id":"100928712224153091054","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928712224153091054","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"best experience i've had","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"100928712224153091054|0x39eb1eb1c6b9ab61:0x1197edcf18f15b83","media":null,"created_time":"2019-06-19 12:51:49.654667","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"James Rose","external_id":"103375259031862042654","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103375259031862042654","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"All good trip with a really friendly","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103375259031862042654|0x39eb1eb1c6b9ab61:0x1197edcf18f15b83","media":null,"created_time":"2019-04-09 12:15:39.128400","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Peaceful Rider","external_id":"109962567561036996373","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109962567561036996373","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":570,"photos":6311},"text":"Best of best. ..","rating":5.0,"likes":4,"external_id":"109962567561036996373|0x39eb1eb1c6b9ab61:0x1197edcf18f15b83","media":null,"created_time":"2019-02-18 14:04:11.068546","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Suzit Maharjan","external_id":"113309099307805765145","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113309099307805765145","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":93,"photos":197},"text":"Best trekking company in Nepal had the best time of my life.

Eco-Conscious Adventure!\nI recently had a fantastic experience with Enticing Himalayas Travels on their Sustainable Plant a Tree tour.  This tour wasn't just incredible for the sights and experiences, but also because I felt great knowing I was giving back to the environment.\nPlanting a seed for a greener future:\nThe highlight for me was definitely the tree planting portion. Enticing Himalayas partnered with a local organization, which shows their commitment to supporting the community and its sustainability efforts.  It was truly rewarding to plant a tree and know I was contributing to the preservation of the beautiful Himalayan landscape.\nThumbs up for Enticing Himalayas:\nEnticing Himalayas clearly goes beyond just showing tourists a good time. They are a company passionate about protecting the environment and its a breath of fresh air to see a travel agency so focused on responsible tourism.\nHighly recommend!\nIf you're looking for a travel company in Nepal that offers unique experiences while keeping sustainability in mind, then Enticing Himalayas Travels is the perfect choice!  They exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to see what other tours they offer.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"118006467121378401035|0x39eb1996d0c4b071:0x5b7b84bad120ddea","media":null,"created_time":"2024-06-12 12:51:49.729190","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Anish Maharjan","external_id":"100496590720284489800","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100496590720284489800","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"100496590720284489800|0x39eb1996d0c4b071:0x5b7b84bad120ddea","media":null,"created_time":"2024-06-11 12:51:49.729190","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"edicsson asuaje","external_id":"113162436687577680595","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113162436687577680595","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":11},"text":"100% recommended, Everything was excellent, good service, the guide was very friendly and willing, It was a trip full of wonderful adventures, it was a very fun and special experience","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"113162436687577680595|0x39eb1996d0c4b071:0x5b7b84bad120ddea","media":["AF1QipOyBsMTdfUqg2lyRJaddnz8wiRxroc65slHz2tI","AF1QipOeH__NhNimIKmZX9hX0AjwOUYhKQDZw50UxCR2","AF1QipOqcPkQNJo3HukoTtTEOzpI6TBBh4jurSulpx9n","AF1QipOu-wRJDkUROlulJACgp9BXd4CJkb09TEuUnzev","AF1QipPrFKLjMoV9YUqjzr6KFVAKLcf2A2ZE9xR17pwq","AF1QipMFDQn5SIg3HxzsLgxYGlNsbnXbOUVtGmYz5ub8","AF1QipOE6lzxObpAMRLVG-VBGUdAiXIPmorW2NJztsAv","AF1QipPZOEO-qPFW3vqOxm4YrRHfqp9475-bNoguvOYf","AF1QipNzB3AAN9Vo41leIBPYApqIAyRNcc8QHeMOkUEf","AF1QipOxGfgoKmwH9BTgN4fdHeTwxCOkel4OeQn6FcWX","AF1QipPDsIWxk7wWlDRQhOZLZ3YfV2DxlSclkl0pGe-d"],"created_time":"2024-06-10 12:51:49.729190","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"–Ω–∞—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –¥–∞—Ä–∏–π—á—É–∫","external_id":"104191483368915042067","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104191483368915042067","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":3,"photos":0},"text":"Anish was very experienced.

We hired  Toyota HiAce seems like a comfortable choice for exploring Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan,nagarkot,  especially with its spacious seating with 14 passengers, we were 4 with two children.  What can I say about our driver cum travel guide named Saazan .Saazan's knowledge of the areas and his ability to find scenic spots for stops must have added to the enjoyment to our trip. Our best experience in Muktinath was unforgettable in a -2c degree as we had two days spares for the adventurous  activity but somehow due to the uncleared weather we had to drop off that adventurous activity and he suggested to visit Muktinath, considering our concerns about the weather and traveling with children but he encouraged  us to visit Muktinath and for that we were so  thankful.\nWe went to jomsong mustang and next day from jomsong we visited Muktinath .\nIn the backside of the temples there are 108 water spouts, in the shape of cow heads.  Hindu believes that the sins fade out if you take the bath on all 108 taps and with  Saazan's recommendation we had bath at the water spouts from the cows heads and that experience  was unbelievable,  Saazan truly made our journey through Nepal was unforgettable!\nWe were for 9 days in Nepal as Nepal's roads are so bumpy we had to travel 8 Hours from one place to another ,but the journey was so smooth as Saazans live singing especially Bollywood songs must have added a unique and delightful touch to our travels, making the bumpy roads feel smoother and the long hours pass by more quickly.

We were keen to get our entire tour planned out by a local Travel agency. After much research & deliberation we finalized on Nepal Holiday Makers Tours & Travels, Kathmandu. And we sure made the right decision indeed!\nWe got in touch with the owner Mr. Dipak Koirala, who eased the entire process from planning & designing our customised tour itinerary, Forex, private car, accommodation booking, meal packages, activity planning et all.\nWe had booked for the ‚ÄúNepal Golden Triangle (Kathmandu-Chitwan-Pokhara) Luxury Package‚Äù which ensured that we experienced Nepal in utmost comfort at our leisure.\nWe were received at Kathmandu airport by our lovely & knowledgeable tour manager Himal, He briefed us about our entire tour plan, local culture, do‚Äôs & dont‚Äôs and introducted us to our private car (AC Scorpio) driver Uttam who would be accompanying us the entire tour length of 6N 7D. The owner Mr. Dipak had specially arranged for his most experienced driver Uttam to ensure that we have a safe & happy journey, as all roads in Nepal are mostly in hilly & mountainous region and more so that we had a small child on board. Uttam came across to be a very sweet, loving, helpful and skilled at his art, non-cribbing & ever smiling person.\nOn check-in at our hotel in Kathmandu, Mr. Dipak Koirala personally came over to greet us and tend to any query or doubts about the entire tour plan. He was in touch on a daily basis to enquire about our well-being and how the tour was proceeding. With all his experience & expertise in this industry, meticulous planning, welcoming & humble nature, always sporting a positive attitude ensured that we truly experienced warm Nepalese culture & hospitality; made us feel right at home!\nMr. Dipak Koirala is a special person indeed!\nFrom the hustle-bustle, sights & sounds of Kathmandu, wild nature & jungles of Chitwan to the beautiful & serene mountain peaks of Pokhara: an unforgettable experience indeed!\nNever would have we thought of welcoming the New Year in such an awesome way!\n‚ÄúNepal Holiday Makers Tours & Travels, Kathmandu‚Äù: Definite recommendation for any Nepal Tour Plan!

His support in country is nothing short of superb. As just one example returning from Pokhara to Kathmandu on this last trek the Pokhara airport was closed due to smog/smoke putting our international connections at risk... a few messenger exchanges with Puru (who always seems to be immediately available to his guests) and 15m later a new electric van with a lovely professional driver arrived picked us up and took us all the way to Kathmandu. Crisis averted while so many others remained stuck and missed flights.

This trip offers the incomparable Everest Himalaya and more from this locale. The path along the Everest Base Camp Trekking are not your straightforward traveling course through the Himalayas but rather a definitive excursion which remains at the pinnacle of all journeying courses. Encircled by the entrancing Himalayas all around the excursion takes us to the hypnotizing perspective of Kalapatthar which is maybe the best perspective to observe the magnificent Himalayas soaked brilliant with the rising sun. The Everest Kalapatthar Trek likewise investigates the Sherpa towns and memorable Buddhist religious communities to offer the hypnotizing magnetism of the Everest domain.\nThe path head of one of the most well known journeying in Nepal starts at Lukla which is likewise home to one of the most exciting airstrips you can arrive on. From that point, the excursion heads towards Phakding following the forested path to reach Namche Bazaar. Taking our first of the two acclimatization days distributed for the excursion at Namche, we head towards Tengboche better known for its cloister and the well known Mani Rimdu Festival. Guided by the Himalayas, the path in the EBC locale journey proceeds through changing scenes towards Dingboche, where we take the remainder of our acclimatization days. The excursion proceeds through frigid tough path heading towards Lobuche at long last arriving at the foot of the world's tallest mountain. Praising the entrancing Himalayan perspectives as observed from Kalapatthar we plummet to the herder's settlement at Gorakshep before plunging towards Pheriche which at that point prompts Namche Bazaar. The path of the Everest base camp journey closes by and by back at Namche where the natural rush of the Namche airstrip is standing by. The months having a place with pre-storm (February, March, April, and May) and post-rainstorm (late September, October, November, and December) are viewed as the best an ideal opportunity for Everest base camp trip.","rating":5.0,"likes":4,"external_id":"110659503166737411560|0x39eb19a440376ef7:0xd4e815fed91dfc76","media":["AF1QipP9DizRYI2QlEwY3Eq2NuFMqkQs_1pZsiwzOfj6","AF1QipNodg5xAl1tDlFlq0UucAaZdhiD79VxBKHAyrZF","AF1QipPRteGI-2-OD7NHoTz5bAZ8hKUWu7ZlvlYEWV0l","AF1QipPpDnY79IuY139PjoNtHBHleWZTTzr78pDirJKX","AF1QipN_Aj9yVHy91eKb7Bf5q-OPN8iIP2gsG5RFiwWF"],"created_time":"2021-04-30 11:42:37.034247","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Ishant Khatiwada","external_id":"102743057364388621164","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102743057364388621164","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":0},"text":"Thank you travel talk nepal.

Tsering Dhargyal was the perfect tour guide as he is grown up in a village nearby and has an excellent knowledge about the Manaslu Conservation Area. While hiking trough this wonderful nature we learned so much about the flora and fauna as well as the villages and the people living there. Guided by Tsering we always felt very safe because of his big experience in the mountains and especially in this area. Another big advantage was also that we could plan flexible day by day with regard on the weather forecast and our personal fitness level. Tsering proposed always interesting options and amazing sidewalks and supported us during the trek whenever needed. The organization and communication before, during and after the trek was also excellent.

Rupak was always very prompt in replying our messages and requests. He even called us in the middle of a holiday celebration to answer our questions.\nDuring the trip, our guide and Porter really went above and beyond to make sure we enjoy the trek.\nWe were lucky to have the company founder Mr Binod himself as our guide. Mr. Binod speaks really good English and he was like a good friend you can have interesting conversations with. And he was the most knowledgeable guide in every teahouse we stayed during the trek. Very often he offered free suggestions to other trekkers when their guides struggle to answer specific questions. He also took time to explain us local food, culture and agriculture, such as how to make Raksi or how to churn yak butter. It was my first time doing a long trek in the high mountains, and our guide always stayed close with me and guided me through landslide area or river crossing. I sprained my ankle multiple times and Mr. Binod organized cold bucket water to sooth the injury.\nOur Porter, Dendi Sherpa (Spelling?) is an excellent cook and was always helping in the kitchen in the tea house. It was a real treat when he snuck out food from the kitchen for us to try :p Dendi also speaks good English and often pointed out interesting things for us to look on the trek.\nLastly, their price was really fair. I guess it‚Äôs still a relatively small trekking company so there aren‚Äôt many layers taking cuts from what your pay.\nIf you‚Äôre considering doing a trek I highly recommend Mount Mania. Also, if you‚Äôre thinking of doing Manaslu, I recommend adding Tsum Valley as it‚Äôs not as commercial as the circuit and you really get to interact with the villagers and learn their culture.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"117950431555385425569|0x39eb18fc1a971375:0x2b5e5104ab777a0","media":["AF1QipOglxKb6PXtZV7bVBhFHPEjQFHk0i5na7PX2yI","AF1QipPztSPQRTdSxkRQpcB9zPMO76W10agOqc47IJ0","AF1QipOjt-al0mRP15knpa6HRi-LjZfiL0eEYR8aoak","AF1QipMWsq4Cxp4PLzEFLOAQ5wRdZXYJhyXbA-P0P_E","AF1QipMm4pTg8fEc1kY4JxIaC3_e6rNXuqwd9oZVOiM","AF1QipOXF-4EV6Pu4SWtYHwbxCZ8FP3PrTQ7wAc8Z9I","AF1QipODp0CC61jGHG-kCX71So4D1WnLZPIySspD2eA","AF1QipPvd7YmZiv9YefZnB5QYpD1xjBfSeg7IvYstRM","AF1QipMyh8HwwoQ70RGPMid8XnJCbr-Kb3QoMngFhI4"],"created_time":"2022-08-24 15:00:02.577221","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESY0NBRVFDaHBFUTJwRlNVRlNTWEJEWjI5QlVEY3lTSFJJTUdSbmVWOWZSV2hDYlVaNFNtbDRUVlI2YjNOcU4zSjNWVUZCUVVGQlIyZHVPVEpSV1VObE1HWlNNa1JKV1VGRFNVRQ==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x39eb18fc1a971375:0x2b5e5104ab777a0"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Mani prasad Bhandari","external_id":"114100113848892147780","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114100113848892147780","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114100113848892147780|0x39eb19c7155921ff:0x251f6baa4865472d","media":null,"created_time":"2023-12-18 00:51:52.118908","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Prajal Sapkota","external_id":"113068782921088546217","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113068782921088546217","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":3},"text":"Best Travel Agency.

He set the trekking pace accordingly to ensure my best success.\nOur porter, Bidur, was also extremely lovely during the trek. He handled my things with proper care, always made sure to have it ready on time by the evening, was extremely friendly and nice to talk to, and provided excellent service and companionship.\nOverall I had a 10/10 experience with Access Nepal: the trip coordinator Sadhana, my guide Om Prakash and my porter Bidur. I would recommend going with Access Nepal if you are looking to conquer the EBC trek or any similar in Nepal!","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"115080636866193332990|0x39eb18fccb2d6c6b:0xb16cd3da2acc274c","media":["AF1QipMUbzZp8-aHCCpzcB59OHkfmQxQGzmz7Szr_70f","AF1QipMtmG2x4JR8h7XC-HTqbBHY0iAP1aIcyUJzrn-2"],"created_time":"2024-04-06 18:35:45.276789","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Guillem ma√±o girau","external_id":"107844939220994690269","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107844939220994690269","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":0},"text":"A great trip, our guide Devman and his 10 assistants!

So I searched for an agency online and came across this one.  After numerous and courteous discussions (high availability), the choice was made for this family agency on a human scale.  The Trek was perfectly organized: welcome in the house, formalities, explanations, meetings with the guide, loan of equipment if necessary (sleeping bag, etc.), donation of t-shirt or polo shirt with the agency logo,  ...\nThen debriefing after the Trek by offering a dinner and hand-delivered Trek certificate.  The members of the agency are welcoming, smiling and open (Arun, Ashok....).  They care about doing the right thing and are very attentive.  The next Trek will still be by them.  Because why change when things have gone very well?\nDo not hesitate to use their service.\nOur guide and porter were very good in everything.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"111181963815769276363|0x39eb19385e39b9c9:0xf2c3122c2ad40234","media":["AF1QipPwRXnA_nH2lKZBOHPSL-QaE76TOhuu8OZ24rM-","AF1QipMgm1W5PaBn62QkS_Ff5PDl9BreeKivoKdRdDJ-","AF1QipNIoJvo2nMs-5dcIOiaoAEbRjWvdA-AXPQATLdV","AF1QipPOB1aQcs_Oed90z_Ga04FVYl223LVBdELKFdvc"],"created_time":"2024-03-18 06:51:52.244417","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Treeju Narzary","external_id":"111803117035518467088","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111803117035518467088","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":1},"text":"Just wow .It great experience as a solo traveller.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"111803117035518467088|0x39eb19385e39b9c9:0xf2c3122c2ad40234","media":null,"created_time":"2023-12-18 00:51:52.244417","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Sonamtobten Sherpa","external_id":"111964842419495888137","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111964842419495888137","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":3},"text":"personalised service","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"111964842419495888137|0x39eb19385e39b9c9:0xf2c3122c2ad40234","media":["AF1QipPD-20LBD8Xp5Vi16hXvbSaSlzxViRVNyPNS3IL","AF1QipMs2eaUzeE0aro1zSWFGKklA_s9ZuvETFDxVxyV","AF1QipPojFQR76F0EdXscPf80QTmzA-jzai0S88PrD45"],"created_time":"2023-06-18 12:51:52.244417","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Sagar Wagle","external_id":"112669790666810485756","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112669790666810485756","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":15,"photos":20},"text":"I went on a trip to Everest base camp and Gokyo with Nepalgram.

As soon as we arrived at Kathmandu Airport, we were warmly received by Bhim, the tour guide of Pure Adventure. Bhim had been communicating with us a lot of precautions, such as packing lists, etc. a few days before our departure. Reply to messages day and night, no matter the time. The next day we were very lucky to have our guide Megh and his assistant Karki lead us on a 12-day trek to EBC. Megh is a cheerful, kind-hearted and humorous senior guide. Through his wonderful and in-depth explanations, he laughed and laughed along the way, forgetting the hardships of hiking, and maximizing the painful and joyful experience of hiking. During the itinerary, one of the travel companions suffered from slight hypertensive symptoms due to physical discomfort the next day. Megh carefully and properly arranged for her assistant Karki to protect her as she went up the mountain. She encouraged and took care of her all the way, and the travel companion finally reached a height of 5110 meters. The altitude sickness worsened and it was not suitable to move forward. Megh sent Karki to escort the traveler back to a hotel at a lower altitude for accommodation, which alleviated the traveler's altitude sickness. The rest continued to follow Megh according to the original plan. The itinerary and accommodation were arranged very reasonably, including stopping at different altitudes to allow the body to gradually adapt to the high-altitude environment. Megh was very patient and helpful if I had any questions, including helping negotiate prices when buying souvenirs. Finally, we successfully reached the EBC route known as a \"hiker's paradise\" on the 8th day. On the 9th day, under the leadership of Megh, we successfully climbed to Kala Patthar again. Travel across the top of the world and experience the wonders of nature up close. Although the time spent together during this 12-day hike was short, what is worth remembering is not only the infinitely beautiful scenery of Nepal, but also the sincerity, kindness and deep human touch of Megh and Karki, as well as the professional quality of Pure Adventure! It is definitely worth going to Nepal again in my lifetime to meet my friends Megh, Karki and Bhim!\n(Shiming from Australia)","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102808720913120964078|0x39eb1b211e9a6363:0xc200d28fbd48bb2e","media":["AF1QipOT2vJ7XVDIHL9CsJu1VhzJoM8OuozptnUZTqaG"],"created_time":"2023-10-13 08:38:01.769314","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"safal shrestha","external_id":"107240373084652105591","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107240373084652105591","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":0},"text":"Very friendly and well guiding team for the pure adventure..

I found many agencies and I emailed them all. I received a response\nfrom Nabin from Himalayan Abode and decided to discuss my trip with him over the phone.\nWe were two adults and two older boys on a trip to Kathmandu. I wanted airport pickup/dropoff, sightseeing on all days and a guide during our stay for sightseeing and shopping. Nabin gave me a quote for my full trip and I considered it a fair price. Since I was not going to pay him anything until I get to Kathmandu, I decided to go with Nabin.\nNabin met us at the airport and took us to our hotel. He wanted to take us around Thamel that evening, but we were very tired. Next day was a religious pilgrimage to Pashupatinath temple. Nabin had made arrangements to get us a ticket for\nabhishekam. After completing the pilgrimage, we went back to the hotel to refresh, and we headed out to see the two\nstupas in the city. The next day we head to Patan and Bhaktapur and it was an all-day trip.\nDuring the trip he acted as our guide at all the monuments and any shopping we wanted to do. He was with us until we got dropped off at the hotel.\nAll in all, I am very happy with the service provided by Nabin and his company. If I ever visit Kathmandu again, I will\ndefinitely get in touch with Nabin.\nPS: I noticed that the US T-Mobile does not work in Nepal. You can get a Nepal SIM at the airport for cheap using your passport. Just make sure your phone is an unlocked one.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"112655786967142132087|0x39eb18e34b4142d1:0x9d49fb570591f9f","media":null,"created_time":"2022-11-09

You can stop looking now.  They are absolute pros in their business.  You are in 100% completely capable hands from the time you land in Nepal till when you leave.   We took a 21 day trek with them to Everest Base Camp, going to Gokyo Lakes, summiting Gokyo Ri, then going over the Cho La Pass and finally to Base Camp. The next day we summited Kala Patthar and then began our hike out.   We stayed in luxury tea houses where they were available, which were so worth it.  Our Guide, Prasant and porter BB were incredibly helpful, friendly and always looking out for us.  They are absolute pros.  We were taken care of like kings and queens, supported each day and they gave us the leeway to change our day and schedule around as we needed.  We saw many other guides from other companies along our trek and never once did we say to ourselves that we wished \"that\" other guide was our guide.  Prasant is hands down a Gold level guide and if you get him you will be a fortunate group.   Passang Sherpa at Highland worked with us to create a custom trip, including exactly what we wanted in the trip, including an extra acclimatization day in Namche (highly recommended!).  He responds quick on email, you get his personal cell and also his employees.  This was a bucket list for us and something we had been dreaming about for years.  It exceeded our expectations in every way.  From our pre-tour in Kathmandu to our amazing teahouses along the way to our stay in Kathmandu to our farewell pizza dinner with Passang and Prasant.

From the moment we set foot on the trail to the awe-inspiring views at Base Camp, every step of the adventure was infused with wonder and excitement.First and foremost, I must commend the professionalism and expertise of the team at Icicles Adventure and Treks. Our guides were not only knowledgeable about the terrain and its challenges but also deeply passionate about sharing the beauty of the Himalayas with us. Their enthusiasm was contagious, and it made the journey all the more enriching.The trek itself was a thrilling adventure, as we navigated through quaint villages, lush forests, and rugged terrain. Each day brought new landscapes to marvel at and new heights to conquer. And when we finally reached Everest Base Camp, the sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. Standing in the shadow of the world's tallest peak was a humbling and awe-inspiring experience that I will never forget.But perhaps the most memorable aspect of the journey was the sense of camaraderie among our group. Bonding over shared challenges and triumphs, we forged friendships that will last a lifetime. Whether swapping stories around mealtimes or cheering each other on during the toughest stretches of the trail, we were united by a shared love of adventure and a deep appreciation for the natural beauty that surrounded us.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"111773632364184623860|0x39eb18faa51bc979:0xf938504aba6dd147","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-18 02:51:55.176718","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Robbie McFedries","external_id":"108915311213048214832","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108915311213048214832","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":"Great company, fantastic trip\nMar 2024\nWhat a fantastic trip, everything we had dreamed of.

We were booked onto the Everest Base Camp trip. Even before we travelled Indira who founded the company was highly responsive and helpful with any information and advice. Our guides Rajkumar and Prabin were fabulous from the start. Unfortunately my partner became unwell quite early on with altitude mountain sickness. He was cared for very well by Raj whilst the rest of the group went on ahead to Namche. We eventually made it but it became very clear that it wasn‚Äôt safe for us to continue. We anticipated an early and disappointing return to Kathmandu but we couldn‚Äôt have been more mistaken. We were offered the opportunity to stay in the mountains, we could have stayed at Namche or a bespoke itinerary was offered that gave us the chance to hike (very slowly) to local villages with visits to monasteries and the school and hospital founded by Edmund Hillary returning to Namche and a much slower descent to Lukla than the usual itinerary. Prabin and a porter Baal Kumar stayed with us whilst Rajkumar continued with the rest of the group and the porters. We had the most amazing time even though we were unable to reach EBC and we were superbly cared for by Prabin and Baal Kumar who couldn‚Äôt have been kinder. Indira also made contact with us to check we were happy with the arrangements which we appreciated. We reunited with the rest of our group in Lukla and had the best last night ever at The Irish Bar.\nAfter our trip we had a fabulous farewell meal back in Kathmandu. Icicles then assisted us greatly with our onward travel to Pokhara. We wanted to travel by road and we were advised to travel only one way by road as the roads were ‚Äúnot very good‚Äù. We chose not to take this advice and it took over 9 hours to travel 200k! Indira contacted us to see how we were and we were able to change our travel arrangements and arrange to fly back to Kathmandu.\nIcicles are a company that go above and beyond and are entirely genuine in their determination to please their clients and offer the best service possible. We very highly recommend them. You will not regret using their service. Huge thanks to Indira, Rajkumar, Prabin, Baal Kumar, all the porters and the rest of the team at Icicles.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"111187674788537780360|0x39eb18faa51bc979:0xf938504aba6dd147","media":null,"created_time":"2024-04-11 04:56:42.415599","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-04-07 22:11:50.616154","text":"Namaste, Thank you so much for your glowing review!

The trek provided a perfect mix of adventure and cultural immersion, allowing me to meet locals and fellow trekkers while learning about the Annapurna region's rich culture.\nThe Himalayas were breathtakingly beautiful, and I'm excited to share some photos from the trek. Each segment of the journey had its own distinct charm, but the Annapurna Circuit trek was particularly memorable. The opportunity to visit local villages and experience the local lifestyle firsthand added a unique dimension to the adventure.\nA special mention goes to Shiba, our guide, whose assistance and advice were invaluable throughout the journey. His knowledge and encouragement made the journey more enjoyable and memorable.\nI highly recommend Asian Heritage Treks & Travels to anyone planning a trek in Nepal.

Regarding the ticket cancellation and date change polices, we had informed you about it beforehand of issuing the tickets. As you postponed your flight to a specific date, as I remembered we needed to cancel flight from Korean Air (which was already issued) and issued a new ticket on Qatar Air. So there was a cancellation charge in Korean Air and the new ticket which we issued on Qatar Air was expensive than of Korean Air.

From our initial inquiry, to finalizing trip details and payments, airport transfers, hotels in Kathmandu and most of all setting us up with our guide Nimesh and porter Birkaji.\nNimesh did a wonderful job explaining the history, culture, and lifestyle of living in the Himalayas. His evening discussions left us feeling prepared for the next days activities. We never felt rushed and always motivated to finish our daily hike.\nWhen you reach EBC I highly recommend the morning hike to Kala Patthar. It was the hardest hike of the trip but so worth it. Seeing the sunrise in the Himalayas is not something I‚Äôll forget.\nAce definitely has some opportunities for improvement. During our trek the tea houses we stayed in seemed to always be older and in worse shape than others. I understand the last couple villages this can‚Äôt be helped but from Lukla to Dingboche we were always in older accommodations. Namche could be the one exception except one room we didn‚Äôt have power outlets and the second the sink didn‚Äôt work and there was mold in the bathroom. I wonder how often anyone from management has actually stayed in these tea houses.\nDuring our post trip debriefing with Sujan. I brought up our concern about the tea house quality and he was very dismissive. He said ‚Äúthey might look better from the outside but inside they‚Äôre all the same.‚Äù I disagree as we checked out other tea houses on the trek and found them to be nicer and some were as little as $10/night for a much nicer room.\nYou will be required to have trip insurance and I recommend you get one that covers a helicopter ride in case your flight is cancelled as this happens frequently. We told Ace we were willing to pay for a Heli ride back from Lukla to KTM but they weren‚Äôt able to get us a flight. We ended up getting a ride with other trekkers who had found a ride thru Heli Everest. If your flight is cancelled and you pay for Heli Ace will not refund your ticket price.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"101712596866819462526|0x39eb18fd323c279d:0x3ce62edb9ffdffaa","media":null,"created_time":"2024-06-09 09:52:11.352762","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"colin de bruyn","external_id":"104300557541485439670","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104300557541485439670","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":47,"photos":52},"text":"Used these guys 2 book and arrange our first trip 2 Nepal.

I want to extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation for Nimesh Nepal. This journey was truly unforgettable, and much of its success is owed to their expertise and dedication.\nHe demonstrated an exceptional understanding of the region, including the terrain, weather conditions, and local culture. His briefings each day were thorough and informative, helping us prepare for the challenges ahead.\nHe ensured we were all acclimatizing properly, monitored our health closely, and were well-prepared for any emergencies. His guidance on how to handle altitude sickness was invaluable.\nNimesh was incredibly supportive, always encouraging us and offering help whenever needed. His positive attitude and tkms of patience were a huge morale boost, especially during the more strenuous parts of the trek.\nFrom accommodation to meal arrangements, everything was seamlessly organized by Ace Himalayas. Nimesh handled all logistics efficiently, allowing us to focus on the trek itself. His ability to adapt plans as needed, whether due to weather changes or individual needs, showcased their flexibility and problem-solving skills.\nNimesh and Kali showed respectful approach towards the climbers s situation and strengths.\nOverall, Nimesh and Kali exceeded all my expectations. Their professionalism and genuine care made the Everest Base Camp trek a truly outstanding experience. I highly recommend Ace Himalayas and Nimesha (guide) and Kali (assistant guide) to anyone considering this adventure.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"105183255198669708741|0x39eb18fd323c279d:0x3ce62edb9ffdffaa","media":null,"created_time":"2024-06-02 02:57:47.731207","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"cyrille Jegourel","external_id":"104824984543509373112","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104824984543509373112","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":5,"photos":0},"text":"I did the Manaslu Circuit in May 2024 with Ace The Himalaya (ATH) and it was excellent. First of all, the trek itself is challenging but amazing. Expect a large diversity of landscapes (forests, plateaus, bushy areas, rocky and icy or snowy mountains, rivers, suspended bridges, hot springs, waterfalls) and wonderful scenery, villages, and people all along the trip. Also, it is important to emphasize that, although accommodation and food remain basic (the trek is not as busy as ABC, EBC, etc.), it is comfortable enough, and we even had sufficient hot water, electricity (and even some Wi-Fi) during the trek.\nRegarding ATH, they were perfect. Yes, ATH was pricier than many companies, but they were responsive and more eco-conscious (we didn't use a single plastic bottle of water in 11 days). In hindsight, considering the extra costs from other agencies and comparing them with ATH‚Äôs high-quality services, I actually don't think ATH is significantly more expensive. If I do another trek in Nepal, I will definitely choose them again.\nI would also like to warmly thank our guide, Shyam, and our porter, Govinda, for their dedication. Shyam was extremely knowledgeable, concerned for our safety, and always caring. Here is a non-exhaustive list of his efforts: he made sure that we ate enough, drank more than 2 liters per day, had enough blankets, checked our O2 levels regularly, and filtered our water daily. Honestly, from what I observed during these 11 days, he was clearly a head or two above the other guides. Govinda was systematically helpful and caring as well. Not only did he take great care of our stuff, but he was also always assisting Shyam. He was always positive and even accompanied us during the resting day! Last but not least, both of them were very nice and are pretty good at (Nepali) card games. :)","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"104824984543509373112|0x39eb18fd323c279d:0x3ce62edb9ffdffaa","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-31 01:41:54.616299","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Christine Black","external_id":"106343006920355279891","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106343006920355279891","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":11,"photos":0},"text":"This is my second trip with Ace, and my second trip with Nima Sherpa.

This individual is therefore unreliable and does not respect his word.\nDescriptions of hiking routes and conditions were written on handwritten sheets with many errors and incorrect dates, which misled us into purchasing our flight out of Nepal.\nDespite our request regarding our preference to avoid crowded treks, our second trek to the Langtang Valley coincided with the Dashain and Tihar festivals, thus attracting many Nepalis to the trail. This led to a large number of people in accommodation, with some being full or even overcrowded, with people even sleeping in the dining room. This experience was extremely disappointing as we had expressly expressed our desire not to be in the company of such a crowd.\nThe guide had no knowledge of the routes or the terms agreed between the owner and us. Which meant that we paid for things that were included in addition to generating several situations. He was unprepared during the treks, not even having a map of the region. In addition, he was not informed of the condition of the trails before our arrival, we were forced to take alternative routes extending the distance and length of the days.\nWe also found that our guide did not carry a first aid kit, claiming that the company did not provide them. We observed guides from more serious companies carrying such kits. What about requiring tourists to use a guide supposedly for security reasons?\nThere was a lack of knowledge regarding trails, distances and times, frequently providing incorrect information. In addition, his level of English was insufficient, making communication difficult despite our efforts to reformulate.\nFor all these reasons, I do not recommend using the services of this company.","rating":2.0,"likes":2,"external_id":"102816528747522525002|0x39eb18fca208f9af:0x90bf37f4885d13a8","media":["AF1QipMvtLpc-MV3SrM2vyGVruoVcaefL4bNvv6_WJ4","AF1QipOhH1LWTU6WuzGmRHwE57KStqvUfOl1LG25CEw"],"created_time":"2024-04-08 20:11:16.834484","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Val√©ry Paquette","external_id":"116205295161882546567","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116205295161882546567","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":69,"photos":46},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"116205295161882546567|0x39eb18fca208f9af:0x90bf37f4885d13a8","media":null,"created_time":"2024-04-03 09:28:50.874127","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Ramhari Acharya","external_id":"103600146864356707943","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103600146864356707943","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":"This is best agent in Nepal for trekking and your.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103600146864356707943|0x39eb18fca208f9af:0x90bf37f4885d13a8","media":null,"created_time":"2024-03-30 01:01:11.891386","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-03-27 07:33:26.326986","text":"Thank you ram hari for your help on google ranking.","reply_to":"103600146864356707943|0x39eb18fca208f9af:0x90bf37f4885d13a8"},"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"St√©phane PERNOT","external_id":"117777088289146598549","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117777088289146598549","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":2},"text":"This is one of th√© best trekking company in thamel, mr Shankar organisation is very Well thanks its my second trip with them\nBest regard from stephane (papa)üòç","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"117777088289146598549|0x39eb18fca208f9af:0x90bf37f4885d13a8","media":["AF1QipMTDJhYMwssJswuBEqIc3BAkr7Whx6TkihRteEr","AF1QipPgAGMz67eYQlMbVunq-Zr6OjlVNC3J_3HSzreM"],"created_time":"2024-03-24 02:27:38.088476","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"gijs prigge","external_id":"109437700096641471160","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109437700096641471160","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":1},"text":"I recently arranged a holiday with friends at adventure leaders Nepal, we walked the Annapurna track and we went to Chitwan Safari.

Right from planning (where Hari considered all our requirements) the finer details of the trek starting a couple of months ago to coordinating it on-ground - Hari's support meant that we didn't have any unpleasant surprises in our long trek.\nComing to Aashman, if you ever need a guide, who has detailed knowledge of the Everest region, knows people who matter (the lodge owners, porters, etc), and keeps up the conversation alive (ensuring no dull moment), it would be Aashman.\nAnd then there's Suman - who would carry our luggage, start either just alongside or after us every day but reach the destination in half the time that it took us.\nYou can't get better shoulders than this team.

Every night I had a great room with my own bathroom and western toilet üëå he explained a lot to me (Altitude of the mountains, local customs, etc.) and showed me monasteries on the way.\nThe porter Anuj had a light game with my 7-8kg üòä he was also very attentive and looked how I was going over the rocks and steps, gave me tips, took also my backpack when I was struggling on the pass, etc.\nSummarized I would book over outfitter Nepal again and felt in good hands over the whole time.\nThank you Ram and Anuj for this experience!!","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106638825716152805714|0x39eb18fd2e2d0c9d:0x82612c61ecf172de","media":["AF1QipMT2hQy4mBCOKTD5pjvWfxt9RXD0C34lmNmgmle","AF1QipMeNxlOd3BIhGhhx3CwFzMCoof8OzAA-rZCMmUm","AF1QipPeUxCi6A9sZgrOcl_15sV-9KJpZhBnn27CqbfJ","AF1QipMc_nMPF10IkPYScswzcNKsGcdH8pDtvhr7AoR5"],"created_time":"2024-05-18 02:51:56.622910","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Josh Metherell","external_id":"117952073080059388891","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117952073080059388891","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":5},"text":"Having turned up in Nepal with nothing booked, we contacted Outfitters Nepal who were able to make our plans a reality. We initially met with Raj and explained that we would like to do a combination of the Annapurna and Manaslu circuit treks in one 3 week adventure. He quickly got on board with this, and suggested a series of side treks to enhance our trip. He was able to organise a guide with just 2 days notice and sorted our permits. We were able to meet Kamal (our guide) the day before leaving and set off on the bus the next day.\nWe went on to have the most phenomenal time trekking around the Himalayas. Kamal ensured we were comfortable and well looked after throughout. He was flexible and allowed us to combine our main trek with a series of great side treks which we often decided on at the last minute! He also advised us on changing our itinerary based on weather and distances, allowing us to go over Larke pass in beautiful sunshine rather than the forecasted rain the next day. Despite being a more junior guide, Kamal provided us with an unforgettable trip and ensured everything ran safely and smoothly.\nOutfitters Nepal and Kamal were professional and excellent throughout - would highly recommend!","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"117952073080059388891|0x39eb18fd2e2d0c9d:0x82612c61ecf172de","media":["AF1QipODC6jiEyTdYx08QorhtNa5nJepTknUqHABPC1Z","AF1QipOvzukfnmf7MjePcL0VTHWs2FJHKFWM2zbK9CBk","AF1QipO2ponJ9l8aUU6G7Lupj0B--66F8-iF52lONIdp","AF1QipMF7rCofq0u4k5pbX9ymM2NXQcsJ-goeMqp5WUO","AF1QipMdk1miEr2XeMrUiPLB3COHS1QEk85frYfmU7IT"],"created_time":"2024-05-18 00:47:03.343466","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"–ü–∞—à–∞ –ú–∞–≥–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∏—á","external_id":"105418180364055523938","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105418180364055523938","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"I would like to express my gratitude to Outfitter Nepal for a perfectly organized track.

Ram did not hesitate a minute to offer the help to get me out of a bad situation. The kindness and care  is something I will never forget.\nThe trip itself was amazing. Since we started I got the insight to every question, background of the cities and places we were passing. Krishna with his kindness and humour was a great guide and company for such a long trip. On every step he was making sure I am getting the best rooms, food and treatment. Along the way we were always choosing the good tempo, making sure we feel okay. With Krishnas experience and insights I got all my questions answered I knew every view and nature around. He was kind not only to me but also to all the people around we were passing. He helped me even to capture the moments on the pictures.

We paid a deposit and then visited their office in Thamel when we arrived. They are extremely kind and professional individuals and we valued their knowledge and suggestions. They suggested we begin ASAP to beat the crowds (a fantastic suggestion) and so we started the trek on Sep 25th 2023.\nOur guide Krishna, was fantastic. He was extremely kind and fun. We were not expecting so much from a guide. He organised accommodation as we went, knowing which villages can become bottlenecked and need to be booked ahead. He kept us safe and organised, checked in on us and shared his own supplies. I would recommend Krishna to anyone.\nRaj let me leave my suitcase at their office and returned safely to me.\nI highly recommend Nepal Gateway Trekking for your adventures in Nepal, and I highly recommend Krishna as a guide.

Our masterful guide was Tilak and our kind, able, and supportive porter was Lahk. To say the trek was successful is an understatement. Everything from the flights to and from Lukla, to the lodging and food was seamless and simple.\nA special note regarding our guide, Tilak. He has been leading treks to EBC for 20 years, and his deep experience shows. We often saw other guides from different trekking companies who appeared disconnected from their clients. Not Tilak.

We (myself and three friends) were in great hands from the moment we arrived in Nepal until we were dropped back at the airport for our return trip home - thanks to our new friends - native Nepalese brothers Govinda and Krishna Panta and their company Adventure Pilgrims Trekking (APT).  From the moment we arrived in Nepal (flight landed at 1 AM), we were greeted by the APT team (including Govinda Panta) and taken to our hotel (the Lo Mustang Hotel in Thamel - two thumbs up).  We then spent two days exploring Kathmandu - including the Monkey Temple, Durbar Square, the Cremation Ghats, Garden of Dreams and the Narayanhiti Palace Museum, amongst others.\nOn our 3rd day in country, with an early 430AM start - we headed to the airport for our early morning flight to Lukla.  APT got us to (and through) the airport without a hitch.  Our flight arrived in Lukla before 7am and after a brief stop for tea, we began our trek to EBC.  APT's trekking team on our trip, included one of the company's owners - Krishna Panta (as our guide) and two porters.  Throughout our trek, Krishna went out of his way to ensure that we had quality accommodations/best rooms available at any given teahouse.  He also made sure our food was prepared/delivered on time so that we could maintain morning departure times. Basically - Krishna made sure that anything/everything we needed - be it food/medicine/tea etc. was taken care of.  He even arranged a last minute helicopter charter for a close up tour of Mt Everest and the Goyko Lakes region before we began our return trek from EBC.  It is clear that APT maintains good relationships with the owners of the teahouses and restaurants along the trekking route.  You can easily tell by the interactions/rapport between Krishna and the teahouse owners/operators.  Krishna also made sure that we made plenty of time to stop and take pictures along the way so that we had great memories of our trek - even at the moments when we were too tired to take our cameras out of our pockets!!\nAfter getting us to EBC and back to Lukla (80 miles all told) - Krishna joined us for our flight back to Kathmandu.  We wrapped our trip with a couple of days of relaxing and souvenir buying.  Instead of sending us to fend for ourselves in the markets, Govinda and Krishna asked us for a list of the items we wanted.  They then proceeded to take us personally to the best/highest quality shops in Thamel where we loaded up on incredible handmade scarves, yak bells, knives etc.  Thereafter - being a bit sore from the trek - they took us for massages, sauna, steam room and even brought a gent to our hotel who provided us all with a clean shave with a straight razor - a welcome treat after being out on the trek.  Our flight back home departed Kathmandu at 215AM, and the Panta brothers delivered us to the airport a little after 11pm.\nIt was an incredible trip of a lifetime and we could not have been in better, more attentive hands than Govinda and Krishna Panta of Adventure Pilgrims Trekking.  I cannot recommend these gentlemen and their company more highly.  They are thoughtful, caring locals with great attention to detail and a true to desire to make sure that you have the best time possible in the country they call home.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103334654162772208772|0x39eb18fd18bb7bef:0x35d15ebe9109f4ec","media":null,"created_time":"2023-12-18 00:51:57.745628","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2023-12-15 16:41:50.049792","text":"Thank you for your kind and in-depth review.

He knew all of the owners of the tea houses we stayed in.  He coordinated nightly to make sure we had the best rooms.  And would reserve tables for us.

Meena was proactive in sending us useful information for the trek as well. Meena is always quick to respond to questions and requests. Even off trek, Meena gave us good advice in Pokhara and Kathmandu - even helped us make bookings in Kathmandu!\nOur assigned guide on the trek, Raju, looked after us very well on the trek and happily improvised/replaned part of the trek after we had some problems with our knees - including booking in advance at some lodges (which he knew was overcrowded due to the local festival/holidays).

During the hiking, the guide Shiva will observe everyone's walking and physical condition.

He felt that my head was not kept warm enough and suggested that I should wear a fur hat to prevent the wind from blowing (actually I wore a sun hat when walking because the sun was very strong). If you keep your head warm, there will be no headaches.\nThe temperature dropped sharply after nightfall, and all I breathed in while sleeping was cold air. When I woke up the next day, my throat was super sore and I kept coughing (my throat was so sore that I didn‚Äôt even want to talk!). My teammates gave me a medicine for sore throat. Coupled with the throat lozenges Shiva gave me, the symptoms of sore throat were relieved a lot, and I found the throat lozenges delicious! After eating, I asked Shiva for 2 more packs as candy! XDD\nAfter reaching an altitude of 4,900 meters, I was out of breath every step of the way. When I went up to Gokyo Ri, I was still out of breath. Shiva reminded me that I was walking too fast and needed to slow down. Fortunately, he reminded me.

We booked with them because already friends of mine did a trek with them and only spoke highly about them.

The hotel was very central, clean and had good breakfast.\nThe second day we met Rajendra and our porter Lalbier. Both were very nice and Rajendra explained us the trek and everything.\nWe started the trek in Pokhara and Kancha and Lalbier were amazing. Lalbier is so strong and when I felt bad, he even carried my day-pack. Kancha has so much knowledge and explains the culture and the tradition of Nepal in such great detail and with enthusiasm it makes you happy to listen. You can feel both of their passion for their job. When I started to get stomache-problems, they were super flexible and helpful. They took amazing care of us and I would definitely recommend them to everybody.\nWe were extremly happy with the trek - we saw how the Nepalese live in the mountains, how they grow their food and how they prepare for the winter. We saw Annapurna 1 and Fishtail and the 7th highest mountain in the world. The view was stunning and the lodges were nice. Kancha made always sure we got proper food and that everything is clean.\nBoth, Kancha and Lalbier did an amazing job and I am glad we booked with them :) Next time we would do the 3 high passes in the Everest Region and I would only do it with them :)","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"109145145866858472625|0x39eb18e0e426a71f:0x240ccbcd59cc681e","media":null,"created_time":"2024-01-09 07:35:40.378272","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Bedanidhi Khanal","external_id":"106687978586070589559","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106687978586070589559","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":74,"photos":654},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"106687978586070589559|0x39eb18e0e426a71f:0x240ccbcd59cc681e","media":null,"created_time":"2023-12-28 19:11:03.551842","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Adam Agriculture Farm","external_id":"111819284310054717452","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111819284310054717452","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"Best Travel operator in South Asia .Feel like home .

It was just perfect, everything worked out according to our expectations. I would of course also like to include our driver Kaka into our thanks. He was not only a skilled and very good driver. He helped us discover things that we had originally not planned to do.\nIn any case, I know now a travel agency that I can recommend to friends if they want to visit Nepal. I would also not hesitate to call upon your services when considering a next visit.\nThanking you again for your kindness, for the nice gifts you had for my wife and myself and wishing you all the best for the future, both privatly and in business, I remain, with best regards, also from Regine,\nCordially yours,\nMarcel","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"117932450585031370085|0x39eb18e330e25fc7:0xed086226d71c9318","media":null,"created_time":"2016-06-19 12:51:58.838218","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Adan Kim","external_id":"107028512473329374141","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107028512473329374141","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"Rhino Travel Agency from Kathmandu is a professional tour operator who organized our 19 days Nepal Tibet Tour last month. We were planning for this trip from 2011 and we really wanted to make it our dream holiday so we researched on internet and wrote to several companies. We receive replies from most of them but we decided to go with Rhino Travel because the itinerary designed by Rhino was different compare to what we receive from other companies and it was something we were looking for. So we started exchanging emails with them and after exchanging some emails, we booked out trip with Rhino Travel.\nAs mentioned above that our tour itinerary was really well designed. All the services we receive from them from arrival till departure from Kathmandu was 10 on 10, Our both guides in Nepal and Tibet were excellent, took care of our needs very well.\nEverything went very good with our holiday in Nepal and Tiber and it is only because of the good taking care of Rhino Travel and its team. So we want to thank you again for organizing our dream holiday in best way. You guys are master.

He was also very engaging, and we spent a lot of time talking to him about Bhutanese culture and history.\nWe started with a day hike to Tigers Nest that also served as our practice hike. We then took off for our multi-day hike through Jigmo Dorji National Park. Sangay and rest of the staff - assistants, chef and horsemen were super nice and always there to help. Sangay even carried backpack for someone in our group all day because they were not feeling well.\nThe chef and his assistant served is fresh breakfast every day, packed lunch and tea and cooked delicious dinner. They gave us warm water to clean up and boiled water to drink every day. The support staff was very diligent in setting up the tents and load and unload our stuff. Everything was always on time (or before time) and they did everything they could to accommodate our requests.\nWe had some issues with altitude sickness / fever and Sangay was very understanding and patient. Sangay knew the hike like the back of his hand. He suggested alternative hiking routes that would allow us to hit all the highlights without making it too demanding physically. We made our way through Shingkharab, Thangthangkha Jomolhari Base Camp, Tshopu and Bongteyla Pass and along the way we had fantastic view of Mt. Jomolhari, Mt. Jichu Drake, Twin lakes and many others. Words can't describe the beauty we witnessed.

Thank you Third Rock Adventures for organising the trip of a lifetime and I hope to be back again soon.","rating":5.0,"likes":2,"external_id":"101368152191132039754|0x39eb18fd72d01b31:0x807defeebd20cbec","media":null,"created_time":"2024-05-19 08:29:26.306684","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"ravi raju","external_id":"102902291409475747828","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102902291409475747828","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":16},"text":"Wanted to take my wife and young adult daughters to Everest Base Camp since I‚Äôd heard so much about it. Being our first time  to Nepal , I asked my college friend who is an experienced trekker for advice and he connected me to Third Rock Adventures and the founder Naba Raj Amgai (the founder) who he‚Äôd travelled with before.\nNabaji was super responsive and shared a lot of information about different options. Since we were short on time we settled on a 6 days customised itinerary just for our family of four including one day in Kathmandu to see some of the places of interest.\nNabaji shared a bunch of pre arrival information to help help prepare us which was very comprehensive. Any doubts were raised via WhatsApp and promptly answered by Nabaji.\n10 days prior to our departure Nabaji created a group chat on WhatsApp to connect us with our guide and his administrative team for any logistical issues.\nOn the first day our Trekking guide Mr. Ganga Bahadur Tamang (Man Bdr) picked us up bright and early from our hotel and we went to Kathmandu airport to catch our private helicopter to Lukla.\nRain slowed us down and we had to stop due to falling light at Phakding. This is where we noticed how well Man Bdr and the Third Rock Adventures team anticipated unforeseen issues and made quick adjustments without compromising on safety and quality.\nThey quickly made calls for us to stay at the Mountain Lodges of Nepal (MLN) property and Phakding. It turned out to be our best stay during the trek with good facilities, nice location next to the river, sumptuous dinner and breakfast, and great service by the staff. Being the first day of our trek , the electric blankets and running hot water in the attached bathrooms were very welcome amenities. Man Bdr continued to share his knowledge and insights about the regions, the mountains and the people. He briefed us at dinner in detail about the trek next day as it was going to be a long one and prepared us in advance.\nWe left early from MLN Phakding and made our way up the valley towards Monju with some amazing views thanks to a clear day. We started our way towards Namche Bazar which is an arduous climb up. My wife was bothered by her knees and Man Bdr kept us at a pace that was comfortable to her. About 90 minutes away from Namche, Man Bdr told us that the trek was going to be a hard one and suggested for a horse for my wife for that part.  Man Bdr was again spot on in his assessment of the situation and gave the right suggestion. After making some calls, the horse arrived and we all made it to Namche Bazar in good time.\nThe place chosen by Nabaji / Third Rock was MLN Namche Bazar and this property lived up to the standard with good facilities and great service.\nSunrise next morning, Man Bdr was ready to take us upto to the viewing point. With fantastic clear weather we set spent over an hour admiring the sunrise over Mt. Everest, Lohtse, Ama Dablam. Man Bdr patiently explained in detail about the various peaks and was always gracious during our entire trip to be the official photographer.\nNext day we made our way upto the well known Hotel Everest View. We took a detour by climbing  up the Namche Bazar face towards Syangboche (highest airport in Nepal) and made our way to Khumjung. Man Bdr was his usual helpful, cheerful and talkative self and continued to share his knowledge and experiences. He knew the places to go for good views, good food, when to slow down if we were getting tired and giving us tips on trekking. He is certified for First Aid and helped each of us track our conditions daily (monitored oxygen levels and pulse rate) and gave suggestions for handling altitude sickness.\nGreat trip on the whole. Customised and choreographed by Nabaji and Third Rock Adventures Team. This team is professional, quick, anticipates issues, makes things happen quietly and flawlessly. And with Man Bdr on the trek with the execution was excellent. I would gladly recommend Man Bdr, Third Rock Adventures and Naba.","rating":5.0,"likes":2,"external_id":"102902291409475747828|0x39eb18fd72d01b31:0x807defeebd20cbec","media":["AF1QipOTRr6aP8_y1FMWX480Axk5neeN5PsoLkIE8duc","AF1QipOIqnl-5Pqe5Huxm_P9TGVXv74G9ykOMoSoaH6B","AF1QipPzdBl40OlmNl7Y4UiBOlJGzB-pwmGiCb2IZnsM","AF1QipO4i30lI7aNX5UfICrZTUbzQ-Fz59kK7YJHoLx6","AF1QipOqJ0HwTAqe6wzEfKNjJFSa6XTB0PeYLLZn0ljF","AF1QipOurVmDvLj-zUf9PcZ_V7dFYGIggEiujE0pl4ih","AF1QipOlyJz7ZIxqB39DGwZk5rXW6w07Z3IaHORWtknu","AF1QipPbv_Y9Tniw75T2MdGjJTQtTYAzgFsz3TdvGEpl","AF1QipOQ4-7oVcVjowi6dOQpPNLpDcLrn_ixBAwYSB1B","AF1QipMJhxeIJx35WwEa04rsqzLLYghNfGmBraBBsPYx","AF1QipOhZqk_cwDG-n5Kw-bzDbrzSI4Y3yEAusUrKmoB","AF1QipOeeyhIGHlP8qpGao_OkuScp47npwUn3Ken4do_","AF1QipNWlfR4Tq93kQyabrdNd4QIKoJkj9G7YBOeSPDS","AF1QipN_kH0Jv6NYMXyzXUmvo4t3U5FP-hX0fIbbfsjA","AF1QipPogM-rodg4jZ5mepkmy5oWVkGpg39ZVvyWQvbP","AF1QipOANqOJie0TZq2g0hqTPjIdfsRqEica-b4qMe1d"],"created_time":"2024-05-18 01:04:42.810173","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Catherine Lindenberg","external_id":"100660509893159220747","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100660509893159220747","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":1},"text":"We are just completing an 18 day tour of Nepal and Bhutan with Third Rick Adventures.

From the very beginning all the way to the check in after I came home, Naba and team were always there to help and very responsive to questions.\nNaba helped me to plan out a customized trip visiting 3 countries and at no point in time the challenge came up for a minimum group size or specific starting dates ‚Äì very important to me as a solo traveler, I was guaranteed to start my EBC trek on a specific day, whether it would be in a group or just by myself.\nHave not found any other company offering that kind of service.\nArriving in Kathmandu, I was greeted with a big smile from Dharma Ojha, who then was my guide for the EBC trek ‚Äì again very personalized approach by the Third Rock team. We ended up with a group of 4 hikers and 2 guides, Ngwang Sherpa joined us as the assistant guide in Lukla. Throughout the trek, Dharma and Ngwang guided, served, and supported us in every possible way and in no point in time, there was a doubt that we would not make it to EBC with the whole team. The first thing in the morning were the smiling faces from Dharma and Ngwang serving us with a first hot drink after the cold nights or had their treats ready at the arrival at the next teahouse. Ngwang became my private photographer.\nWe were very lucky with the weather ‚Äì Sunshine most of the time ‚Äì and the whole experience will last for a lifetime. Being around these high mountains, you realize what little role we human being play in this big world.\nThank you Dharma and Ngwang to guide and show us this part of the world.\nAlso, a big Thank You to Mr. Jaya from Third Rock who took me on the Kathmandu City tour as well on the Patan and Bhaktapur Sightseeing tour. The wealth of knowledge he shared with me transformed me back into the time. He took me to places, I would not have found myself ‚Äì again a fantastic experience ‚Äì thank you Mr. Jaya.\nFinal Stop was the place of Happiness - Bhutan, where Yeshi Wangdi was waiting for me to show his country, the monasteries with their temples, the dzongs and the dramatic landscapes. The highlight of Bhutan was clearly the climb up to the Tiger‚Äôs Nest Monastery, while challenging, worthwhile and a must do while in Bhutan. Yeshi showed me a country which is going through a huge transformation and modernization of their political system while valuing tradition and history. There was no question Yeshi left unanswered ‚Äì Thank you for showing me your country Yeshi.\nAll in All, I can highly recommend Third Rock Adventures if you look for a travel operator with personalized service, super friendly team members who take service very seriously.\nThank you, Naba and Third Rock Adventure team","rating":5.0,"likes":3,"external_id":"111661408644686554777|0x39eb18fd72d01b31:0x807defeebd20cbec","media":["AF1QipNwdonSy0thRxhDz-Eu0YDX4ptoMw5JZgusuMA_","AF1QipNzUgbE1MgSn5uRF_c8OQz_IorbWMQsZi54ba_L","AF1QipO3az5w1xA3P6KPOmLNvEwcbwrZ2KlQb_ipDYGb","AF1QipMeb4ek5f7B_9tavOZKIxM8Avx9EOsaU0s9lWyF","AF1QipNyu6_vfVwS2G2614STOpLHCD7RVf142izhUf2j","AF1QipN_izPslOEXzrN5iV0Huu_6tiE69S2Lih7SB4oe","AF1QipPfyADHsJ3U5_xnvjqhUl5xcYFNF6t2j63rQGIM","AF1QipMvgYHqlaOmjcy6g4B1m9waCW3nVih9IU8j30k-","AF1QipNEOyCTjZupbJ72oNd_OpDOd412NRHA1B_YS2rb","AF1QipOa7_89lwtDxMe8EIonLvkrpsFr5bUBDBGkcOYj","AF1QipP36_f_F6JGrmoChrrTYgmtE6NbHx9rP1FA1luE"],"created_time":"2024-05-15 23:02:04.567325","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESY0NBRVFDaHBFUTJwRlNVRlNTWEJEWjI5QlVEY3lTRUl6ZW5ZeVlWOWZSV2hCVEVkTE0zVnZabkUxYW1sNVYwa3pZMEZCUVVGQlIyZHVPVEpRUlVOalNHWlBYMXB2V1VGRFNVRQ==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x39eb18fd72d01b31:0x807defeebd20cbec"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Abin Bhattarai","external_id":"111527077974939115712","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111527077974939115712","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":13,"photos":21},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"111527077974939115712|0x39eb184a8c91cf5b:0xf412759f2f88dc42","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:51:58.953071","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Mandipa Rijal","external_id":"114610811363012916809","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114610811363012916809","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":"I feel so satisfied with their services üòä","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114610811363012916809|0x39eb184a8c91cf5b:0xf412759f2f88dc42","media":null,"created_time":"2018-06-19 12:51:58.953071","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Akshov Shrestha","external_id":"100986321627839758498","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100986321627839758498","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":10,"photos":8},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"100986321627839758498|0x39eb184a8c91cf5b:0xf412759f2f88dc42","media":null,"created_time":"2018-06-18 08:37:01.477534","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Kritika Khatiwada","external_id":"100142560326128401559","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100142560326128401559","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"100142560326128401559|0x39eb184a8c91cf5b:0xf412759f2f88dc42","media":null,"created_time":"2018-02-05 01:56:06.592323","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Keeran Khatiwada","external_id":"109515502845638612607","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109515502845638612607","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"Good ride\nHelpful","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"109515502845638612607|0x39eb184a8c91cf5b:0xf412759f2f88dc42","media":null,"created_time":"2017-10-22 03:10:44.622645","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Bharat Shrestha","external_id":"111679316313720891398","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111679316313720891398","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":7,"photos":0},"text":"Reliable and fast service","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"111679316313720891398|0x39eb184a8c91cf5b:0xf412759f2f88dc42","media":null,"created_time":"2017-06-19 12:51:58.953071","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x39eb184a8c91cf5b:0xf412759f2f88dc42"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[{"name":"ticket","external_id":"/g/11c5s_zh78","count":2},{"name":"tour","external_id":"/m/09xp0b","count":2},{"name":"car","external_id":"/m/0k4j","count":2},{"name":"price","external_id":"/m/01d_1l","count":2}]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"sabee sapkota","external_id":"110186953164689142318","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110186953164689142318","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":1},"text":"me and my family booked pokhara tour with this company.It was amazing time in pokhara they arrange us car and hotel in pokhara in very resonable price.Thanks Raj...","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"110186953164689142318|0x39eb18e2ea0c482b:0xf3fa55f6abe04760","media":["AF1QipNbDYk4RLk8BGipNyUe_qDrtlPYlt-2niBSr9jf"],"created_time":"2023-11-17 14:51:58.990420","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Namaraj Timalsina","external_id":"113954892111424804875","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113954892111424804875","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"We have booked Mukatinath Tour 4 night 5 days  trip from Kathmandu along with VIP Super Deluxe Bus ticket and Pokhara Mukatinath tour from this agency Rajendra was friendly owner who help me arrange my tour memorable.

We were very pleased with how they addressed our individual needs. For example, we wanted to start the trek from Pokhara and not from Kathmandu, which posed absolutely no problem.\nWe booked a trek to the Nar Phu Valley and the Annapurna Circuit through the agency. The whole process from planning to borrowing equipment was easy and very tailored to our needs. For example, three break/acclimatization days were planned so that we were perfectly adapted to the altitude.\nOur guide Narayan was one of the highlights of this adventure.

I have never met someone this honest in the travel industry. There were multiple times when Hemanta suggested that we do not opt for something so that we could save on cost. I traveled with my husband and 12 year old daughter, so I had a million questions that I asked Hemanta over a period of a month, he was so patient in answering all my questions and clarifying all my doubts. This company is quite reasonably priced too. He barely took 5% of the total agreed amount as advance to make my hotel and flight bookings. Our trek was from Lukla to Hotel Everest View at 3880m above msl, he and our guide Sarjan ensured that we were extremely comfortable all throughout our trip. Our Lukla flight got cancelled on the first day, but they made sure we were in the first flight the next day. And on the last day, after trekking from Phakding to Lukla, we were supposed to stay in Lukla because by then all flights operations would have been stopped. But they coordinated so well to put us on the last flight out of Lukla the very same day, which meant that we reached back in Kathmandu bang on time. My cards weren't working in Nepal and I was stuck without cash, Hemanta gave me Nepali currency about 4 or 5 times in return for transfer of Indian Rupees to his account. He was always there for us. Sarjan, our guide, made sure he explained everything on our way to Syangboche and never missed a single aight seeing point. Hemanta and Sarjan together have made it the most wonderful and memorable experience for us as a family. He made sure that all my requirements were met during this holiday. We would like to do the EBC trek next season and there is no doubt Hemanta will be the person I am reaching out to.

Mr Gyanendra knows these valleys and hills like the back of his hand, is expert and has excellent English - importantly is great company if you plan a solo hike. It was a fantastic experience with Mr Gyanendra and I would recommend this to individuals or small groups that want to experience the hills, peaks, villages and local life in and around Nepal.

Especially the owner himself, Shiva, is sincerely one of the most thoughtful and whole-heated person we have ever met! He organised the Manaslu Circuit Trek, a few days in Pokhara, a visit to Bandipur, a Safari in the Chitwan National Park as well as some a lot of sightseeing in Kathmandu for us, including all transportation in private vehicles, Jeep, luggage transportation and domestic flights and hotels. We did not have to worry about a single thing during our 3,5 weeks in Nepal thanks to Shiva and his team. Especially thoughtful was, that he was calling or texting us every day to check on our safety, well-being and worry-free state of mind :)\nIn addition, he organised a super warm welcome including personal pickup at the airport and a birthday party for me with an delicious dinner and a huge surprise birthday cake.\nShiva takes also a lot of his precious time to have extensive exchanges during breakfast about Nepali culture, his approach of doing sustainable and encouraging business or further travel plans.\nAlso it was great that we had the chance to exchange via video call several times with him and also our trekking guide to clarify the itinerary as well as further details and questions even weeks before our journey.\nAll in all Shiva and Sabbatical Explore Nepal made our trip so uniquely that we will never forget Nepal and the exceptional hospitality of Sabatical Explore Nepal and the whole team.\nIf you plan on doing Manaslu Trek as well, please as for Binaya Khanal as a tour guide. He is a local from the Manaslu Area and knows the best hotels along the trek, as well as each and every stone, plant, river, just everything.... and he is a hilariously fun guy to hang out with. Binay also gave us always the feeling of being in the best hands, having everything under control and always checking on our well-being and caring for us. He did not even hesitate to carry some things of my backpack when I caught a cold during a few days.\nSightseeing in Kathmandu: please ask for Saraswati Ghimire as a tour guide. Also absolutely friendly and professional, highly knowledge, really open and communicative, fun and structured!! She knows so many things about Nepali culture and history, Buddhism, Hinduism, the people, the city and life in Nepal and most importantly is able to explain all those things in an understandable and entertaining way.\nMany many thanks to Shiva and the whole Sabatical Explore Nepal team and hope to see you all again soon!","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"118061437577284666073|0x39eb199e35bdd84d:0x696b5c212e84b488","media":["AF1QipNhJg3vvjgOIDv87v4_9X79fWkzGmLJlaExMdD_","AF1QipOxAWr_1djPSdKUSkJeH3CZXE-MeykzypBCfN1V","AF1QipP_XXs-7MJNo0XXtlhvfw-nTqeQGw5QIkp3ZT_3","AF1QipPK28FkEItxSl2PeuC5awoxLanAQuoZlOMA6gJ-","AF1QipNrLxucJBYiUFPueQwDRKyNi9ba46G2NWG-zg2T","AF1QipOg1sIGKZo8WnlqjS-WtjS9CczaZFTrdnF8LsrU","AF1QipMiOIWSqZVST6Mh2SPzNyXfxNJ7rZz4kbpnfazC","AF1QipOs2vGwyGDwqbz0Z8TqFmT04bupP-TfTlbJdrV5","AF1QipPpYAsKI6KUQp39289WOMA2jU0-COnYufy9W3QO","AF1QipPVba5u7_vYbkFrRGIYSiXFrf6MFJ9dDH1PjJcl"],"created_time":"2024-04-15

We have never taken a trip like this before. It was always our dream, but due to our inexperience we were quite unsure at first. Prakash from Prime Himalayas supported us so professionally in the preparations that we quickly gained confidence in the trip and the company. That's why we booked various excursions (in Kathmandu, to Pokhara and to the Chitwan National Park) as a pre- and post-program through Prime Himalayas before the trip and were not disappointed. Everything was perfectly organized. In particular, our guide Ganga on the EBC trek was great. He explained everything in a comprehensible manner and exuded a calmness that made us always feel like we were in very good hands. Unfortunately, we were unlucky with many of the flights we booked (due to smog, wind and weather, etc. flight cancellations and delays) - Prakash never let us down and organized alternative transport if necessary. Overall, it was a wonderful trip that we will never forget. We can only recommend everyone to make their dream of a trip to Nepal and the Himalayas come true and get involved in the adventure. Prime Himalayas is the right partner for this.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"115332723364356478890|0x39eb18fc5944ba91:0xad96b5bc273d9875","media":["AF1QipMWjlNbhHcX2ZrTgIvOgG4dQ-vcSMfbWlg4Pl4X","AF1QipPRuvkZTkedDLG2Y0dgJaA6OgF4BzpzGOpFFBh5","AF1QipMjgVaIFZOzfhp7bNM2NSOwPJp48kPc56iF4O8q","AF1QipM3t04Cf7bDP8MR_uFRyU6_mLvYbglD27NCLpvn","AF1QipPsPDp-_veO7_7OeMrTQjJv0NpiSwrb0MiGVmTr","AF1QipP_CCktPLFkpbS2vw-fQOWZpR8KBcEMGIkRBCS0","AF1QipO5Ug2mRbHlGstJfwPry-IziDq9G_8RYrKRhdL1","AF1QipPN27mD3YXyAWgGKkhpzZdCPL2DuJ8Eiakgn8E0","AF1QipNKEm0gzyzO3tQUQvP4GU3T81ME3IPhjSzL3xPR","AF1QipMhlMKdhuV65KmOdDhNm3DwqQ7ek01ftLw5NKXG"],"created_time":"2023-08-18 08:51:59.814409","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2023-08-09 03:35:28.674181","text":"Dear Michael, Namaste.

self and partner would completely recommend.\nWe booked with them a two week expedition on the Annapurna Circuit, an adventure which will be with us for the rest of our lives.\nNepal was a completely new experience for us and trekking such a large circuit such as Annapurna was even more so. Landing in Kathmandu with  a ton of nerves and anxiety about the experiences to come we were greeted on our first day by Roshan & our guide Saga, introducing themselves & country. With tea, tours and talking, we were more than able to put near all our anxiety and nerves at bay.\nOver a week later, Saga met us in Pokhara picking us up to start our tour of the Annapurna Circuit. From day one of knowing Beyul in Nepal we were introduced to; culture, food, language, history but above all landscapes & experiences.\nHospitable, understanding, kind & supportive. These attributes never failed Saga & Roshan (even through our moments of despair & tantrums), they were there for us, pushing us, stopping us, being by the side of us, delivering us the most amazing memories and an adventure to rival adventures.\nSaga, our guide, if you're lucky enough to have this passionate, innocent and confident friend with you on this journey, will look after you.\nUnfortunately, due to an injury we were not able to complete the circuit, however our emotions were sad, with the feeling of failure & loss of more memories to be made on the trek. Regardless, Saga & Roshan were there for us; supportive and understanding, ensuring we were well protected, safe but above all happy!\nBeyul is a brilliant company, putting guests experiences, happiness & safety first above all else.

submitted Mera Peak using Outdoor Himalayan Treks.

They were able to make adjustments to our itinerary as we were trekking and made changes to allow for us to fly back from Lukla at short notice, as we wanted to experience the flight. Accommodation during the trek was well chosen, with excellent food choices throughout. We were never hungry!\nOur guide and porter (Bishwas and Raj) were both superb. Bish was great company throughout the climb and looked after us every step of the way. Once we reached the final aspect of the climb we were equally well looked after by our climbing guide who was incredibly supportive in helping us to successfully reach the top, in challenging conditions.\nOn returning to Kathmandu we had a wonder final night meal before leaving for the airport.

The trip was organized well, from getting picked up at the airport, to being delivered back to the airport at the end of the trip, everything went very smoothly. The drivers, guide, porters, office staff, airplane flight to Lukla, Lodges, food, and everything in between was very well thought out and well arranged. There were no planning mishaps. The guide had even carried fruit for us to share along the trek, which I thought was very thoughtful.\nThe guide Suba was very knowledgeable and experienced. If you take an altitude trek like this, make sure you hire porters and a helicopter flight back down to Lukla, it is well worth it, when you are tired at the end. The manager Badri was very kind, understanding, and also it was obvious he really cared about doing a good job and about the trekkers.\nI didn't quite make it, as I got altitude sick and had to be helicoptered back, but the trekking company made sure that in Kathmandu everyone stood ready to care for me and was kind and checked up on me in the hospital until I was released two days later. The trekking company had foresight to ensure all trekkers had insurance for this. So nothing came out of my pocket for these expenses.\nThe office is also located very centrally in the Thamel district of Kathmandu so it was easy to find on foot if you are staying nearby.\nI went on this trip solo and was matched with another solo traveler. Care was taken to make sure the needs of each trekker were accommodated for (i.e. the other trekker was a bit faster and stronger and went with the porter to higher altitudes during acclimatization).\nAny changes I would recommend is to request to plan a trip like this over a longer time-frame to have more acclimatization time, and to also request for the guides to walk just a tad bit slower. We were always the first ones at the Lodges for the day having most of the day without much to do, I would have preferred to stop more along the way to see the scenery more and get to the Lodges later.\nAlso on my initial itinerary a traditional Nepalese meal with some sort of performance was planned, but somehow later that got erased from the plan, I would have liked this event. But I was tired too, so it was not a big issue.\nI would recommend to check your Itinerary and double check costs always as they change frequently.\nI was very happy wit this trekking company and plan to go back with my son next time.\nThank you Outdoor Himalayan Treks!","rating":5.0,"likes":4,"external_id":"102823005654634188789|0x39eb18fd2b8a089f:0x893adb868488a4db","media":["AF1QipP8nbpF8TMY8ffh5rxX2A49jwmBpwyKeDXiDnVY","AF1QipMbg67CM5yip3pqNWKvn_I87ob1l68VXAiiBeX-","AF1QipMuS_uR62mZUGwO7MBPzIzlzhWI1VSSvIcxa4un","AF1QipMl1aXHlqDZp933TegC-sK0jsQ_RuSEDrwSJ9MV","AF1QipOr7b4cJBYPGGUh33ZBPXPTEak1vw09DkMPfyKs","AF1QipOW7aUP55zk0XXYo-_hLZJdn7fw_Ephr2lQHDD6","AF1QipP79nvwApoG9hOrMNDsH8uQjDPRRd13R12t6Z4g","AF1QipMyvTea9ck_AqZ4_RlqBlCy4NjBaQZXjpyUx7DH","AF1QipOglDp_C4Dp_-XKgEJeZKFwl9MuG2-Lj6_Pmoxa","AF1QipOFgQjC7feaDj38M_fJm5vbAkKWnrQOi8TNSMdv","AF1QipPkMTgvuhZGsrxHhfxmjvEEjCDm3cpikHY2MozS","AF1QipO8YIusjJUs9pQUXaY35GwaC4Pq118n4jDQCefG","AF1QipMlmfJd1t_VibrC0BQ-BY7NYGcIE6T3kzKzZlOt"],"created_time":"2024-03-11 11:33:47.861594","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Astrid Grindlay","external_id":"106761150320921459467","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106761150320921459467","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":6,"photos":14},"text":"It is really hard to put into words just how amazing Outdoor Himalayan made mine and my husband‚Äôs experience in Nepal. From the communication beforehand to being met at the airport to being welcomed to the hotel to celebrating Dashain with the staff to the hike itself (Mera peak) to our wonderful guide and so so many other things, this company was fantastic. Ram (CEO of the company) welcomed us like a part of the family and he was always on hand to ensure our questions were answered and that we were getting the most out of our trip. We had recently got married and were on our honeymoon in Nepal and we were actually treated to an insane surprise just before our planned departure from Kathmandu to Lukla (which should have been a long drive followed by a plane flight) that we were instead going to be flown directly from Kathmandu to Lukla by helicopter, courtesy of the manager of the company. Neither of us had ever flown in a helicopter before and this was genuinely one of the most memorable and special experiences we will ever be lucky enough to have - seeing Everest amongst the Himalayas from the air is something we won‚Äôt forget. Despite starting on such a high, the hike didn‚Äôt fail to disappoint. We did the Mera peak trek which takes around 13 days in total. Our guide (Biswas) absolutely made our trip - he was so knowledgeable and patient and kind and funny and we had a really great time getting to know him over the two weeks. He made the time fly by and was just great company. He was also really good at ensuring we did extra acclimatisation walks on some of our shorter days so that we would hopefully be prepared for the push to the 6476m we would need for Mera. Our porter (Radz) was also fantastic. Everything was sorted for us - the accommodation on the route was great, we were helped with ensuring we had the correct gear (including the down gear and snow boots and crampons), and this organisation just meant we could focus on enjoying the challenge of the trek. Everyone we met from the Outdoor Himalayan team was great - there were so many thoughtful touches, such as being taken out for a congratulations meal when back in Kathmandu. And the team also ran out on our last day to get us some farewell momos (our favourite food in Nepal) and we had some momos and beers with them before we needed to head off for our flight. I really cannot overstate how glad we are and lucky we feel that we chose this company to do our Nepal trek with. We had chosen them based off blog posts we had read and I cannot emphasise enough how happy we were with this choice - you won‚Äôt regret it! It made our trip one of the most memorable travels we have experienced and I am pretty sure we will be back out to Nepal in the future to do other treks with Outdoor Himalayan!","rating":5.0,"likes":4,"external_id":"106761150320921459467|0x39eb18fd2b8a089f:0x893adb868488a4db","media":null,"created_time":"2024-02-16 20:52:00.091220","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESY0NBRVFDaHBFUTJwRlNVRlNTWEJEWjI5QlVEY3lTRXR2WkVoMFdsOWZSV2hFWW5sRVdEWlNkVmxWZUZOcVprVkpkMEZCUVVGQlIyZHVPVEpTU1VOamNXZ3daVEZyV1VGRFNVRQ==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x39eb18fd2b8a089f:0x893adb868488a4db"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[{"name":"trekking","external_id":"/m/012v4j","count":11},{"name":"company","external_id":"/g/120z18l3","count":8},{"name":"guide","external_id":"/g/11qbrjv1tc","count":7},{"name":"adventure","external_id":"/m/0h_m","count":5},{"name":"professionalism","external_id":"/m/01qkbx","count":5},{"name":"team","external_id":"/m/011l78","count":4},{"name":"choose","external_id":"/m/048krps","count":4},{"name":"planning","external_id":"/m/0217bt","count":3},{"name":"agency","external_id":"/m/02gp31","count":2},{"name":"spirits","external_id":"/m/04shl0","count":2}]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Ayesha Adam","external_id":"107438505944461239892","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107438505944461239892","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":10},"text":"Fantastic experience, Beyond the limits trek went out of their way through our the trip.

Kevin came into our life during our time in Lukla March 2020 and from there we formed our friendships and planned our onwards travels to Everest Basecamp and Gokyo Ri.\nThere's an awful lot inbetween (133 days is a long tme!) but let's say Kevin and our wee clan made a pretty great team and eventually after all the Nepali red tape and expert negotiating skills from Kevin we achieved our dream of walking to Everest Basecamp and Gokyo Ri. Total of 230km, the kids walked, talked and at times moaned, but we did it!\nKevin was a part of our family and to this day we care for him greatly.

Highly recommended. \"","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103427397894995268638|0x39eb190bc71b075d:0x1f615c4e2b1eb3f2","media":["AF1QipM-lnDuCsgJRgFcYk5RNdpuZLv8dwG8CNSgeXwc","AF1QipNu6HrWKHm65WlCi9Nay98wqgq_TciyLyI6rGcF"],"created_time":"2023-07-18 22:52:00.555672","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESY0NBRVFDaHBFUTJwRlNVRlNTWEJEWjI5QlVEY3lTR0ZmWkhOTmJGOWZSV2hEZDFSQlEzTndORm96WWpSUVUwaGZTVUZCUVVGQlIyZHVPVEpoUVVOa2Nqa3lkM2xWV1VGRFNVRQ==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x39eb190bc71b075d:0x1f615c4e2b1eb3f2"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Sangita Bakai","external_id":"107459774386002460439","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107459774386002460439","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"107459774386002460439|0x39eb1995e305b9ad:0xfd421e31047fa743","media":null,"created_time":"2021-06-18 12:52:00.563808","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"ShareGyan ‡§∏‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®","external_id":"117644155817573208512","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117644155817573208512","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":240,"photos":1048},"text":"Nice","rating":4.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"117644155817573208512|0x39eb1995e305b9ad:0xfd421e31047fa743","media":null,"created_time":"2021-03-04 03:56:13.455966","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x39eb1995e305b9ad:0xfd421e31047fa743"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Rushang Sunuwar BSc (Hons) Computing","external_id":"118012353799916623410","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118012353799916623410","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"118012353799916623410|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2024-01-17 10:52:00.925090","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Sumit Bam","external_id":"114335495485400814311","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114335495485400814311","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114335495485400814311|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2024-01-13 16:33:19.938425","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Sandip Regmi","external_id":"100563162119535623144","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100563162119535623144","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"Very worst waste of money","rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"100563162119535623144|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2024-01-06 00:45:13.194248","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Abi zeet","external_id":"104444065919721921726","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104444065919721921726","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":128,"photos":44},"text":"Very conjusted place","rating":3.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"104444065919721921726|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2023-06-18 12:52:00.925090","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Prashant Shrestha","external_id":"109596610894652251880","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109596610894652251880","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":7,"photos":129},"text":null,"rating":3.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"109596610894652251880|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:52:00.925090","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Rayyan Khan","external_id":"116220453472129198047","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116220453472129198047","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":13,"photos":7},"text":"It's kinda of travel agency where you can find multiple service at one point such as traveling tickets, money transfer or tour packages etc","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"116220453472129198047|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2021-12-29 06:03:43.190120","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"T 4 INFORMATION","external_id":"113890341710383786122","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113890341710383786122","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":9,"photos":2},"text":"Very Informative ,good service. best price provided","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"113890341710383786122|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2021-06-18 12:52:00.925090","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Texas Boys","external_id":"114808106603475503878","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114808106603475503878","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114808106603475503878|0x39eb1977d0c6dee3:0x97992865d4d709cb","media":null,"created_time":"2019-06-19 12:52:00.925090","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"sangat lincoln","external_id":"110552178108651649024","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110552178108651649024","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":31,"photos":0},"text":"Its bad.

Before the trip Sunita helped me with ALL my questions about the trip. I didnt know what I wanted and she explained everything and did care of all my doubts and questions. She responded in a very short time. That I really appreciated a lot !\nThe whole company is very transparent about how they organize and how the guides are involved in the company. Really great.\nThrough out the whole trekking Khirlal and Sunita kept contact with the guides or even us how we are. They are really concerned about us and how we are doing. It seemed like they are genuine care about each coustomer.\nOur trip:\nAs we arrived for our first trip to Nepal. Khirlal and Pasang ( our 1. GUIDE) Waited for us in the front of the airport for over an hour, because we didnt recieve our laggage. At 2 AM they drove us to the hotel.\nThe next morning Sunita,Khirlal and Pasang were waiting for us in the lobby of the hotel. They brought us all the equipment we needed. It was free of charge. The sleeping bag, poles and cramps were provided and were of really good quality! I never got cold on the trip because of this sleepingbag:)\nPasang took really good care of us during the EBC trek. He showed us his culture, even we could join into a ceremony in a monestary! The EBC was very hard!! But Pasang took really good care of us, and answered all of our questions about everything:) we were very happy and thankful Pasang did the trek with us. We had a wonderful time with him and our porter Man Kumar. Through out the whole journey our motto was \"bistare bistare\"- slowly slowly. And we really needed it !\nOn the 2. Trek I was travelling alone and this time I got the wonderful Guide Alina Lama. She took care of me for 1 week. I did the Annapurna Circuit by myself.\nThe guide chose the lodges spontanously every day. Alina did have very well choices on small beautiful Lodges to stay. She told me a lot about how being a guide in ABC is. And I saw an independent wonderful woman who did not only shared country with me but also her culture.\nUnfortunately I couldnt complete the track due to HAS. But then It started Alina organized everything. And helped me what ever I needed.\nHAS is no joke, and in that situation Alina did a really good job in doing what ever it took to secure that I am safe. Thanl you Alina!\nThank you for having me/ us in your country and made us feel welcomed and safe!

My first choice was Overland Tibet with EBC. Unfortunately, the new regulations didn't allow a solo traveler like me to go to EBC unless I was in a group, and we didn't get any more willing traveler to EBC. I thereby proceeded with the trip minus the EBC part. There were some initial hiccups with the permit and visa, thereby the departure date getting pushed back by 2 days and subsequently curtailing the trip by 2 days. It was upsetting as I had paid for the full trip of 7 nights and 8 days. However, the team at Tashi Delek made arrangements for 2 extra days in Lhasa after the completion of the scheduled trip. That was very nice for me to get to explore Lhasa. I would definitely go back to Tashi Delek for my trips in future in the areas of their specialization. A special word of appreciation goes out to the very young and dynamic travel consultant of Tashi Delek, Ms. Sujata Maharjan, who was very dedicated and consistent with her service. Her service made things work out for me as desired, to have a good travel experience.","rating":4.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103589787724731571899|0x39eb18fd1c3d2b35:0xc1ef31e0f0d8f2b5","media":null,"created_time":"2019-11-18 06:55:46.237520","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Maira Webb","external_id":"103078286856420333790","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078286856420333790","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":"An unforgettable 9 days trip to Bhutan!

The whole communication before we arrived, the trek itself, and the service around it were just pure perfection. Santosh picked us up at the super busy Kathmandu airport and explained everything. Then it was entirely up to Suraj (our guide) and Konga (our porter). They were super experienced guys who made the trek enjoyable, safe, and mostly fun. We were very lucky with the weather, which certainly helped. In the end, we had some spare time to explore Kathmandu. Santosh immediately offered his help, so we met Kumar (our city guide), who showed us all the temples and briefly explained the history of Nepal. The farewell dinner was just the cherry on top. We will never forget this trip, and hopefully, we will get back for another trek one day.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"103389509103979260406|0x39eb18fbf05a0415:0x53d3918ec4edfe33","media":["AF1QipPbW2BG5hdyYGrSm5ap2M1dHVWxDJVVkhV7TMFX","AF1QipNTilJ0mY9Z7Aj4xvoL87WFJDfZF7ui4DsEvyK7","AF1QipNSNz9cpL3lZ4KFSr25GLlM0aM072Xj2OTaEuPL","AF1QipMlLs0NrFmSNx8lyLJbgPXWQJw2YHS-3xLByJEi","AF1QipM9PNcLIRsOp8WP4CXVEKLDI2e7GOSRLRg1rq-A","AF1QipPY52PT23jWj6MSSsExEyf2wYtjSwcHJy6NQamx","AF1QipPVvK8yuof_vvsPWZ_IxTwBF5iR9-wBCuYagelv","AF1QipNahtQVhj4_hpFPYUYMIDgzfnThivK9u4-jznlA","AF1QipPDxohNaySzJs6opksbZNUCI32qaG6uItcQxQh6","AF1QipNuJAV_xncjV3bn53RempG829ou8lF8UTKPucU5"],"created_time":"2024-05-27 12:52:01.624581","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Toh Beng bin","external_id":"101456486456752295776","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101456486456752295776","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":14,"photos":122},"text":"Fantastic trip with the nepal trekking company pvt ltd\nWill be back in future for sure üëç","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"101456486456752295776|0x39eb18fbf05a0415:0x53d3918ec4edfe33","media":["AF1QipNJzXxRJYZmDrpcPBElnNjLIiTmch3hBZ8nEr0h","AF1QipO-NsEO5aa-UDmd9iHSaMOnLhm6Fs44n9RMROBY","AF1QipNo1mfHaXyZhc8ZCmVjaN11zS6sNxCF3g311i-K","AF1QipPtxAsutw85soa93lZrMURISZ3eG8Jlcgdwxmwt","AF1QipOLUwwo5ETQz28e4nHycn8Jf7trHmt9GHapbjAq","AF1QipPMfVHB-LJHYBBrzqBxP9HV8sv87m8mw9WvRNYj","AF1QipNC2fXFUL3JhzMWvgZWX3icHd1xzN6F9XW9TCva","AF1QipMj_812YZJ7fNntMU1SBFQsCBhZCGppq0tyumnp","AF1QipOeplycHZlb-pcxqQ86DLbx2ove-0zEgvEUwSPq","AF1QipOMe9iH5lKv0nAB_ue3DWA4VtPtnvpOr1fg3i5U","AF1QipOLCr1hND_3s3_2PRTGYs3XmKfsUi1ZyRfMGCSc","AF1QipOAudRiwQrpSXROKTdicznR5pybh4kP8jBZ3t-z","AF1QipMXvolppfN_KaK2vMuNlwRA5KNFp77xCJuI_26e","AF1QipMaEjkBbSTN8uuHyBD1K6ST4JMgzxsUaJkp6OpS","AF1QipOFy0MRIkX5b9yTAoK6Th0DxmO4hn2G5v6vMtA8","AF1QipMI9Awqnw52wrF-vJmk-KNWchfZhfTTS_sIWrgp","AF1QipOIXNbKGjWeEHAjsFLuhyZGfASiQCUpNMfhbfsO","AF1QipOzPnpX2RqM3FAAW62WliB5-g9XdG5V7V8X1nTE","AF1QipO8u7-Y0xLeRIwnmAXfRqZzVXoM9o4kcjkyLl3M","AF1QipPPQ9YvfjLCkR5Bjeob-ztf_2ajNtjOCrLWH3sM","AF1QipMhxR7U_j3FZB2c-r-H5L8dRiSNwcHNIRp5UItc","AF1QipPB66mR02_v2NJ1qJC6msI9y_ohx9pYugOcjZJN","AF1QipNN8ke_oN6DRDcOJ4xmJ8d2hEHZn9bEAJ8HhVQz","AF1QipNtIfzqHkKM6IqJWoJ6-eOK9QDnxWBz05TZozSu","AF1QipOIL_AN8MCBXRNQ9zn-f1zz9Q-fL3e38CbPQVQ2","AF1QipPmTIoXGOR302HRpm2AFeeV69Dt8GcTZwMdsSCO","AF1QipNYFd3XRQTmDMDxKgs-NOKydss2BwAoBrixNC-g","AF1QipOS9leKzE3okGvsu29UzNIklOpYEcomp19TONkI","AF1QipNP2Jf0FiuwKeFw-5sFtFoAoCr4Ox_2gQPBFusR","AF1QipPdzpp5jiGmbWVxUbxmZz0iJcc7xHt9BrFn81nN","AF1QipPlqFSiUvUAR4Bp8cvlJ9uFnYnL4Wx_cMVHqCIC","AF1QipM88R1EbFKDM5T9bIYYvPh2qZs54ln8kcz1P63R","AF1QipMxeaQJok_wBztVZPZjZx3_J7v9YrVGAtPFGU6g","AF1QipOTwrHUEGEqfSz-KnuhTkq8D8zuq0hfnoxheEkc","AF1QipNnJ9_JpFarONPvs-PL5zmTQ0XY3cm3BIXriDzJ","AF1QipOMhufQZcXaQ7KAUrSqiteSsSGvxpmVy-5VgzD-","AF1QipN9uopAkQry0YZx5D5I9rg4ZV4NSw2_ji5gL77c","AF1QipOfSkcrBbCsTrd6H2IESBkYIPfrbhaqiKl287Yd","AF1QipMq_v92hAvSB169VZjZDarVYkLCh80TuvbVo8ov","AF1QipM-tckxM95OUK6TSv5573rEfOySuNRrKRICo10m","AF1QipNqtMIR-DEUDKNhHH9pl21RENDH_CW3XO3MhzbV"],"created_time":"2024-04-17 16:52:01.624581","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Kieran Reid","external_id":"115252480923227597871","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115252480923227597871","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":4,"photos":0},"text":"Whenever going on a trip of this nature, with so many moving parts and so much room for error, having everything planned out and trust in those doing the planning / organising is essential, and in the Nepal Trekking Company we had that in abundance.\nI rarely do reviews, but such was the quality of the trip from start to finish by Santosh and Co that I have chosen to.\nFrom day 1 of booking, to the end of our trip, the care and attention we received was second to none.

Everything about this company and the experiences provided excelled our expectations.\nCommunication has been excellent from the beginning. As laymen for trekking, we had so many (annoying) questions to be asked from Santosh Adhikari - the owner of the Comany. But he was really patient and was insanely supportive with the detailed explanations and answers given. The easy going attitude and the friendly manner of communication deserves 5 stars!\nAnd he gave us the best offer possible, which not a single competitor could even come close! Package - 5 Stars!\nThe guide - Shraban Adhikari is simply the BEST! He was not just a guide, but was also a friend and a mentor for us until the day we left. With 24+ years of experience, this English speaking guide gave us detailed explanations about everything which we came across. And he managed to get us the best accommodations and recommended the best meals to have in each tea house. Even when we went to any shop, he was there to bargain with the local sellers and get us better deals. Guiding - 5 Stars!\nOur beloved porter - Ganga had to carry more than double the amount of weight than we agreed for, due to some health issues which we unfortunately came across. It was remarkable. Without his help, we definitely wouldn't have made it to the top. He did all of this, without even complaining a bit! This kind man deserves 5 stars for sure!\nThe guide and porter went beyond their job and cared for us before, during and after the trek. Even when we paused trekking for a bit, to catch our breath, they were kind enough to not let us remove our backpacks and get the water bottle by themselves. Up to THAT level, they were concerned about our comfort. This deserves 5 stars!\nAt Deurali, I was almost gonna give up due to Altitude concerns. Shraban was observant enough to notice this and took my bag and let me walk without a bag. Simply put - I wouldn't have made it to the top, if it wasn't for Shraban and Ganga, period.\nThis is a trip that we'll never forget. The Nepal Trekking Company made sure of that.

Raj and his team took very good care of us, even when bad things happened and were very responsive both before and during our trip (download WhatsApp before you go if you don‚Äôt have it).Great person to work with! We were a group of 5 adult family members- retired Mom and Dad, our 32 and 28 year old daughters and our son-in-law. Raj customized a 15 day trip for us which included 2 nights in Kathmandu and a tour of the city. We then had an overnight in Pokhara before going on an 8 day Annapurna Base Camp trek, back to Pokhara and then to Chitwan National  Park.\nThe service from airport pickup (by Mr. Dhamala himself) to drop off was excellent.\nOur tour of the sites was great. Raj met us at our hotel and turned us over to our very good city guide who took us to beautiful sites.\nOur trekking guide and one porter then drove with us on the 9.5 hour journey to Pokhara where we were in a really nice hotel.\nThe hike:\nWe drove 1.5 hours from Pokhara to start hiking in Nayapul and stayed in Ghandruk, Chhomrong, Bamboo, and Deurali, before reaching Base Camp. Then back down to Bamboo and Jinhu Danda. Besides being very attuned to our wishes, our guide Kiran was a really knowledgeable and personable guide for the trek. He could talk not only of nature but of the history and politics of his country as well. Unfortunately, my daughter had to turn down mountain in Deurali because of her suspected altitude sickness and Raj and Kiran arranged for one porter and I to accompany her. The other porter and Kiran continued on to ABC with the 3 remaining members of our party. Raj was very involved and in frequent contact with our guide- making these new arrangements for our health‚Äôs sake and making sure we met up again in Bamboo.  After the trek and back in Pokhara, my son-in-law got food poisoning from a town restaurant and had to be hospitalized at the Caremark travelers hospital (luckily just a five minute walk from our hotel and with great care). Again, Raj really helped us out and arranged for another night at the Pokhara hotel and changed our transfer to Chitwan to the next day. He is so caring and kind -he wouldn‚Äôt even charge us extra for the hassle.\nA jeep picked us up for the 4.5 hour drive to Chitwan. We stayed at a lodge near the park that had its own set program and meals. We had a very good naturalist that took us on a walking tour of the village and to the river for sunset. The next morning we had an early canoe safari and a later jeep safari. The hotel was nice with air conditioning and a lovely pool.\nWe are so grateful we booked with Himalayan Trekkers and Mr. Dhamala and highly recommend them.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"117867942058969276662|0x39eb18e5e7bb8cf9:0x5e2b821a264792b","media":["AF1QipOaMXJAcU8jAzuHm6tq3ITY9BJgFsEFsJt1rlp2"],"created_time":"2024-05-13 18:07:51.317498","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-05-09 17:08:08.333129","text":"Dear Lisa, Thank you for your kind feedback.

I did the 15 Nights 16 days Tour and Trek, which reflected Nepal's culture, tradition and history, along with a couple of short treks.\nThe trip was organised to perfection, from being picked up at the airport,(and return to collect lost luggage), the choice of hotels. Raj visited the hotel in Kathmandu on several occasions to make sure everything was ok, shared some food and drinks with him. The guides were fun to be with and were very knowledgeable, and each made sure that you were well looked after, even when some dodgy food struck!\nMy trip coincided with 2 main festivals, Maha Shivaratri and Holi Day (Festival of colour), amazing to participate in. The food was fantastic and full of flavor, you must try Momos!\nThe easy hiking trips were a 2 & 3 day trek, to Namo buddha Monastery and a stay overnight with the monks, and Pokhara to Australia camp, Sarangkot, Pokhara. Awesome views of the three of the highest Himalayas, i.e., Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, and Dhaulagiri Himalayan ranges, the sunsets and sunrises are something you will never forget.\nI had a fantastic 1 night  homestay with Sushma in Chitwan, where the family shared their home and food with me, they were so freindly.\nI added a couple of days on the end of the trip and Raj and his team went out of their way to organise the additional accommodation and trips that I wanted to do.\nThere was too much to put into words in a short review but there were over whelming colors and sights ands sounds. The sites were awe inspiring.\nRaj and his team were extremely communicative and easy to reach. I highly recommend Himalayan Trekkers to all types of travelers. If/when I return, I will definitely use them again.\nIf you want to visit Nepal, for any reason, I would highly recommend Raj and his team.","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"114115098795105923221|0x39eb18e5e7bb8cf9:0x5e2b821a264792b","media":["AF1QipPhBk597APeJjsTEakiGz71R8g815sjkTkH8MfV","AF1QipNGfmBAoR9EYFNroafA1EcJYT5i8AjSSHGyYiAT","AF1QipPz4gANCvxaYmC3FqW1Fdms6E6DG-q4pyHWq3nL","AF1QipOPTbQvSYZeP_ufUtQsoVrJ4Ry9HzAQwHzDDiZu","AF1QipMnph91Z7ljHVtg0JB2mbH04ZFx57Tz0Dxyw-V2","AF1QipNodPoM8sOJfGIN7lmJZDipZ1BPCQXpY4VeCuBJ","AF1QipPL18MyyOJK83CUZl43Xtre9OFoVsnhCwJS_aTP","AF1QipMK9M5ENNqCJi9qZ7b-aAnzxzpPYERXH7IGk5Jy"],"created_time":"2024-05-06 14:48:52.686430","reply":{"is_owner":true,"created_time":"2024-05-04 06:01:35.822562","text":"Dear Jon, Thank you for your kind feedback.

His subtle but absolute command of every detail gives the most enjoyable and safe experience in getting to the summit. He has a real passion for what he does with great knowledge of the mountains, trails and terrain. Ngima constantly made sure our gear was in good condition, that our water was properly boiled day and night and did his absolute best to make sure we had a safe and unforgettable trip. .

He was always making sure we were happy and comfortable. A brilliant guy.\nMountain Monarch pride themselves on 1 Sherpa to 1 trekker. Other companies have 1 Sherpa to 2 trekkers loading the Sherpas up to 50 kilos so please make sure that is something you consider when booking any company in Nepal.\nOur Sherpas, Prabin, Buprendra and Ramesh were fantastic.

Ltd. to discuss a Everest short trekking. Mr. Dipak Pande (Manager) of Mountain Rock Treks & Expedition was quick to reply to our questions every time. So we decide to travel with them. We paid 30% in advance by credit card as a deposit. We paid the balance in USD cash at the hotel on the day we entered Nepal.\nWe flew by helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla. Then we walked to Namche in 2 days. The next 3rd day we flew back to Kathmandu via Kala Patthar by helicopter. The trip was more memorable than I could have ever imagined. The cost was expensive, but I have no regrets. We hope to travel with Mountain Rock Treks & Expedition again someday.\nThankfully we borrowed a duffel bag to be carried by a porter for free of charge. The helicopter did not fly as scheduled due to weather and airport traffic, but fortunately it did not significantly affect our trip. Real-time communication in English via WhatsApp with Mountain Rock Treks & Expedition and our guide was convenient and necessary throughout our stay in Nepal and during the trek.

After five minutes of calling the mobile phone number I left on Klook, I drove away without getting a response. The customer service's explanations were also very repetitive (sometimes they said the driver would drive away if they couldn't contact me, and then they said they had to wait until the end of the gathering time. The problem was that we didn't see the person holding the sign or the car at all!) His instructions were unclear.

The tour was beautiful, like the view and the nature, but also easy to walk. However. because of the heat and a locally contracted flu, quite challenging. So don't underestimate it! Compliments to the guide Ram, he has a lot of experience and you can have him as a travel buddy on the go. If you like a joke, Ram is always in for one (or a few).  I definitely recommend this tour if you are short on time and want to experience hiking through the Nepalese mountains.  Depending on the season, you have fantastic views during almost the entire trip on the Annapurna mountains, Ram can tell you all about that.","rating":5.0,"likes":1,"external_id":"101460945294936997195|0x39eb18e2c59f8f5d:0xc9124577320dc6e9","media":null,"created_time":"2022-08-21 00:20:46.043931","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":{"token":"CAESY0NBRVFDaHBFUTJwRlNVRlNTWEJEWjI5QlVEY3lTREpDZDFwd1RWOWZSV2hEYTNOd1ZrNXVNRUpKU0U1UWEyUnNPRUZCUVVGQlIyZHVPVEl5TUVObVdVaENiV3QzV1VGRFNVRQ==","page":2}}},"idx":"0x39eb18e2c59f8f5d:0xc9124577320dc6e9"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Pramod Sapkota","external_id":"110462491839155342618","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110462491839155342618","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":26,"photos":90},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"110462491839155342618|0x39eb195c4fbeea17:0x4cb6f282bd546310","media":null,"created_time":"2024-01-17 10:52:02.718027","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"bikers zone","external_id":"113025111089972569013","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113025111089972569013","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":0,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":4.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"113025111089972569013|0x39eb195c4fbeea17:0x4cb6f282bd546310","media":null,"created_time":"2024-01-13 13:52:44.244192","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Sajna Shrestha","external_id":"117883883804829570481","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117883883804829570481","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":1,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"117883883804829570481|0x39eb195c4fbeea17:0x4cb6f282bd546310","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-18 12:52:02.718027","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Asan Khatri","external_id":"117628449474932854609","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117628449474932854609","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":1.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"117628449474932854609|0x39eb195c4fbeea17:0x4cb6f282bd546310","media":null,"created_time":"2022-06-12 19:35:40.621160","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x39eb195c4fbeea17:0x4cb6f282bd546310"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"Reaper Gaming","external_id":"102791241771503796938","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102791241771503796938","is_local_guide":false,"reviews":2,"photos":0},"text":null,"rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"102791241771503796938|0x39eb196853a57671:0xc07373551b6a2335","media":null,"created_time":"2023-07-18 22:52:02.723712","reply":null,"attrs":null}],"pagination":{"to":null}},"idx":"0x39eb196853a57671:0xc07373551b6a2335"},{"reviews":{"data":{"topics":[]},"rows":[{"author":{"name":"andrzej nieckula","external_id":"115135388540919674389","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115135388540919674389","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":6,"photos":11},"text":"Professional components with the advance tourism","rating":5.0,"likes":0,"external_id":"115135388540919674389|0x39eb19a9c00f5beb:0x3cd12709213a07a7","media":null,"created_time":"2024-04-17 16:52:02.736219","reply":null,"attrs":null},{"author":{"name":"Krishna Sarraf","external_id":"116088231043985823291","url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116088231043985823291","is_local_guide":true,"reviews":48,"photos":2},"text":"Vistara Airlines authorised partner.

What an incredible experience. We had booked our trip with Jwalant and team several months ago, after glowing reviews from friends who had been with them in April 2023. In spite of high expectations, Jwalant's team delivered above and beyond. We were a group of twelve from the bay area, DC and seattle area, recreationally fit and viewing this trek as a once in a lifetime goal. We had two primary guides, Pasang Kaji Sherpa (P.K) and Rinji Sherpa and two other assistant guides, owner/herder of the yaks (technically Zyokpyos) for the duffels, and another person to provide general help/hot water throughout. Rinji, PK and the other guides were exceptional, managing the sub-groups and pace, helping with the meals, setting up when we got to the lodges, describing the peaks/sights along the way, and in general enriching our experience with their stories. We had two emergencies along the way-one person lost a parent and had to get an emergency heli ride back from Dugla, and another had altitude sickness and brought back quickly down to Lukla from Gorakshep. In both cases, the guides/Kathmandu team managed it very competently and with compassion, even getting a relative to walk an hr from their village and provide the trekker company during the Lukla transition. Certainly felt like family by the end of the trek!

Ngima Sherpa and NMMT! We booked a trip for May 2020 with them - COVID intervened and we quickly got ALL of our money back - so it was a no brainer to go back to them in 2022! We were not disappointed. We originally wanted to explore Bhutan and Tibet as well, but since they were closed, Ngima redid the trip to encompass Nepal only. They worked closely with us to create the trip of a lifetime. Kathmandu, 8 days trekking to Ghorepani and Khopra Danda, then Bandipur, Nagarkot‚Ä¶we were in expert hands from start to finish. Our trekking guide, Angelu Sherpa was amazing. Set a good pace but insured we could keep up. He really took care of us throughout. In Kathmandu, Toshi and Lakpa got us wherever we needed to go with ease. Super flexible - drove us to meet with friends, got us Kamal, an excellent local guide, drove us to get COVID tests for departure‚Ä¶. Whatever we needed or wanted they accommodated us. This is a local, family-owned and operated company - MUCH preferable to those big tour operators based in UK or Australia. Friendly, personal‚Ä¶they took care of us like we were family. They were the best, no question. If you are thinking about Nepal - and you should because it is INCREDIBLE, NMMT is the only way to go.

The focus was on getting to know the country and its people. Eco Holidays gave us a perfectly coordinated tour suggestion. Individual wishes were taken into account, and you can easily make program changes on site during the trip.\nI particularly liked the fact that special events could be spontaneously incorporated into the daily program without it becoming stressful. For example, we were able to take a relaxed walk through a fair, and we were also able to experience a water buffalo market and the Shiva holiday Maha Shivaratri. A spontaneous stop at a wedding party was also possible. These were very special highlights in addition to the other countless great other sights: Kathmandu (Garden of Dreams, Durbar Square), Pasupatinah, Boudhanath, Patan and Monkey Temple, Chitvan National Park (with safari by jeep and boat), Manakamana Temple, Saswat Dham, Lumbini, Tiraulakot, Rani Mahal, Pokhara, Aarti ceremonies, Sarankot sunrise, Bandipur, Bhaktapur, Nagarkot, Namobudha. Photo stops are also easy (if traffic permits).\nWe were also very satisfied with our guide ‚ÄúGiri‚Äù. He has a lot of experience, provides a lot of background information, responds to all requests and handles everything in a completely uncomplicated, calm and humorous manner. Thanks to his sociability, we often had brief conversations with people along the way.\nThanks to Giri, we strolled through many streets off the beaten track and were able to get an insight into typical life. He was also our perfect advisor for local cuisine. We really wanted to try authentic dishes and Giri pointed out these offerings wherever possible and recommended.\nA big compliment also goes to our driver, who got us through the traffic chaos, which is very difficult for Europeans to get used to, absolutely safely and with incredible calm and composure.\nIn summary, I can say that the tour was excellently organized. It was possible to contact Eco Holidays at any time. Our guide was available at any time and organized everything very competently. My expectations were more than exceeded, absolutely recommended!

Received all the necessary information before departure and Ashok at the main office always replied swiftly to any emails. The actual trek already started out great, as the staff at Mountain Travel were able to secure me a coveted and rare high season plane ticket to Lukla directly from Kathmandu (not Manthali Ramechhap). My trekking guide Surendra was amazing. He stayed by my side at all times, closely monitored my health throughout the trek (really seemed to care too) and we adjusted the trek a little when I showed signs of altitude sickness. He was very knowledgeable about the area and always managed to find me great places to stay (often in relatively luxurious rooms with ensuite bathroom where available). Mountain Travel also supplied me with things like a warm sleeping bag, crampons to cross the Cho-La glacier, and the occasional medicine. I was worried before I left whether Mountain Travel would live up to their great website and promises, but now I can say I would gladly book another trekking with this company.
